<CommitComments>	<CommitComment>Alrighty, we have backwards moving logic complete! Now pieces should move back to their original stack if need be. We also have logic complete for moving off the board, every piece moved off the board increment the pieces owner&apos;s score by 1. We also have added players turns, now you cannot move a piece unless that piece belongs to you or you have no other moves. After each move, players turn is set to the next players turn.</CommitComment>
