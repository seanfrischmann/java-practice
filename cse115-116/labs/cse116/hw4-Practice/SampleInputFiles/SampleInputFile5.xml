<ArticleTitle>NO and N2O formation during the combustion of wood, straw, malt waste and peat.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The NO and N2O formation behavior of six biofuels (spruce wood, beech wood, alder wood, straw, malt waste, peat) was studied in a formation-rate unit under conditions relevant to a fluidized-bed combustor and a grate-furnace. The concentrations of CO2, CO, CH4, other hydrocarbons, NO, N2O, HCN, and NH3 were measured in the flue gas, shortly after the burning fuel particles. Most of the fuel nitrogen was released during devolatilization (66-75%). Relatively high conversions to NO were found. N2O was formed but also rapidly destroyed by the reaction: N2O + H - N2 + OH. HCN was also formed in quantities similar to NH3 even during wood combustion. The HCN3 ratios seemed to depend on the fuel H/N ratios. The experimental results supported the hypothesis that the nitrogen of wood and other biofuels also exists in heterocyclic structures. With the proposed NO and N2O formation mechanism the  effects of fuel nitrogen content, temperature and oxygen partial pressure can be explained./METHODS</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>A population genetic analysis of the potential for a crude oil spill to induce heritable mutations and impact natural populations.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The primary environmental impact following an oil spill typically is acute toxicity to fish and wildlife. However, multigenerational effects through toxicant-induced heritable mutations might also occur. Some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) components of crude oil are potentially mutagenic, although specific components and doses that induce mutations are poorly known. We applied population genetics concepts to assess the extent of mortality and the persistence of deleterious heritable mutations resulting from exposure to potential mutagens, such as crude oil. If lethal mutations are induced, the population will experience some mortality, but the mutations are quickly removed or reduced to low frequency by natural selection. This occurs within one or a few generations when mutations are dominant or partially recessive. Totally recessive alleles persist in low frequency for many gene rations, but result in relatively little impact on the population, depending on the number of mutated loci. We also applied population genetics concepts to assess the potential for heritable mutations induced by the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska, to affect pink salmon populations. We stress that breeding units (e.g., streams with distinct spawning populations of salmon) must be considered individually to assess heritable genetic effects. For several streams impacted by the oil spill, there is inconsistency between observed egg mortality and that expected if lethal heritable mutations had been induced by exposure to crude oil. Observed mortality was either higher or lower than expected depending on the spawning population, year, and cohort considered. Any potential subtle effect of lethal mutations induced by the Exxon Valdez oil spill is overridden by natural env ironmental variation among spawning areas. We discuss the need to focus on population-level effects in toxicological assessments because fish and wildlife management focuses on populations, not individuals.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Effects of agriculture, urbanization, and climate on water quality in the northern Great Plains.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The Qu'Appelle Valley drainage system provides water to a third of the population of the Canadian Great Plains, yet is plagued by poor water quality, excess plant growth, and periodic fish kills. Fossil algae (diatoms, pigments) and invertebrates (chironomids) in Pasqua Lake were analyzed by variance partitioning analysis (VPA) to determine the relative importance of climate, resource use, and urbanization as controls of aquatic community composition 1920-1994. From fossil analyses, we identified three distinct biological assemblages in Pasqua Lake. Prior to agriculture (ca. 1776-1890), the lake was naturally eutrophic with abundant cyanobacterial carotenoids (myxoxanthophyll, aphanizophyll), eutrophic diatoms (Stephanodiscus niagarae, Aulacoseira granulata, Fragilaria capucina/bidens), and anoxia-tolerant chironomids (Chironomus). Principal components (PCA) and dissimilarity analyses de monstrated that diatom and chironomid communities did not vary significantly (P &gt; 0.05) before European settlement. Communities changed rapidly during early land settlement (ca. 1890-1930) before forming a distinct assemblage ca. 1930-1960 characterized by elevated algal biomass (inferred as beta-carotene), nuisance cyanobacteria, eutrophic Stephanodiscus hantzschii, and low abundance of deep-water zoobenthos. Recent fossil assemblages (1977-1994) were variable and indicated water quality had not improved despite 3-fold reduction in phosphorus from sewage. Comparison of fossil community change and continuous annual records of 83 environmental variables (1890-1994) using VPA captured 71-97% of variance in fossil composition using only 10-14 significant factors. Resource use (cropland area, livestock biomass) and urbanization (nitrogen in sewage) were stronger determinants of algal and chiron omid community change than were climatic factors (temperature, evaporation, river discharge). Landscape analysis of inferred changes in past algal abundance (as beta-carotene; ca. 1780-1994) indicated that urban impacts declined with distance from point sources and suggested that management strategies will vary with lake position within the catchment.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Variability in responses to nutrients and trace elements, and transmission of stressor effects through an estuarine food web.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Aquatic systems are increasingly exposed to multiple stressors from anthropogenic sources. These stressors can vary in the consistency and magnitude of responses they elicit in biota and in how the presence of additional stressors modifies their effects. Understanding how the biological environment and temporal dynamics influence responses to stressors, and how stressors interact, is important to predicting their effects in the natural environment. We examined temporal variability in responses of an experimental estuarine food web to elevated trace elements and nutrients, as well as non-additive effects of the combination of these two stressors. Experiments were conducted four times during spring through autumn 1996 in 20 l-m3 mesocosms. We measured a range of system-, population-, and individual-level parameters to quantify responses of phytoplankton, bacterioplankton, heterotrophic nan oflagellates, copepods, fish, and benthic invertebrates to trace element and nutrient additions. The response to trace element additions was more variable both temporally and among phytoplankton and higher trophic level taxa than was the response to nutrient additions. Most taxa increased, either significantly or showed a trend toward increasing, in response to nutrient additions in all four mesocosm runs. In contrast, the direction as well as the magnitude of responses to trace element additions varied considerably among taxa and experimental runs. Two distinct types of nutrient trace element interactions were important. First, temporal dynamics of nutrient ratios appeared to affect the temporal pattern of toxicity of trace elements to phytoplankton. Second, in the June mesocosm run when trace element additions reduced production, abundance, or growth of many organisms, these reductions  were often proportionately greater in nutrient addition tanks than where no nutrients were added. Our results suggest that considerable temporal and taxonomic variation in responses to trace element loadings are likely to be seen in field settings even under constant loadings to the system and that trace elements may mask the magnitude of the response to high nutrient loadings in eutrophic systems. More generally, the presence of multiple stressors may either increase or dampen the temporal and spatial variability seen in aquatic systems, depending on the interactions among stressors and the influence of background environmental conditions and sensitive species on the expression of stressor effects.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Biogeochemical cycling of PCBs in lakes of variable trophic status: A paired-lake experiment.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  A paired whole-lake experiment was conducted on two remote, atmospherically driven lakes in the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) to examine the stresses of trophic condition on air-water exchange and settling fluxes of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Lake 227 (L227) and Lake 110 (L110) are similar in volume, surface area, and watershed area but differ significantly in trophic status. The two lakes have similar access to atmospheric PCBs but eutrophic L227 may exhibit enhanced air to water exchange due to greater biotic uptake of dissolved PCBs. Settling fluxes of PCB were significantly greater in eutrophic L227 (40 ng m-2 d-1 in 1993; 29 ng m-2 d-1 in 1994) than in oligotrophic L110 (22 ng m-2 d-1 in 1993 and 17 ng m-2 d-1 in 1994). Dissolved SIGMAPCB concentrations were not significantly different in the two lakes ( 0.3 ng liter-1). Greater SIGMAPCB settling fluxes in L227 vs. L110 coupled with  similar dissolved concentrations after June supports the hypothesis that air-water exchange supports the water column PCB concentrations. Surprisingly, SIGMAPCB fugacity gradients in both lakes indicated that net volatilization dominated during the entire ice-free period, requiring another source. A SIGMAPCB mass budget in the epilimnion of each lake over the stratified period showed that the major PCB losses were due to settling and volatilization. SIGMAPCB settling losses were 2.4 times greater in L227 than in L110 due to higher settling particle fluxes. The mass budgets suggest that the major PCB input to these remote lakes is from the watershed. Our results indicate the intimate environmental linkage between atmospheric, land, and aquatic PCB reservoirs.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>How environmental stress affects the impacts of parasites.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Parasites occur in nearly every population. They often interact in complex ways with other stressors. In some cases, the interaction may lead to a disproportionately negative effect on the host population. In other cases, the stressor may ameliorate the effects of parasitism. Here we illustrate intersections of four types of environmental stressors with infectious diseases. First, pollutants may increase parasitism by increasing host susceptibility or by increasing the abundance of intermediate hosts and vectors. Pollutants can also decrease parasitism if infected hosts suffer differentially high mortality, parasites are more susceptible to pollution than their hosts, or if pollutants negatively affect intermediate hosts or vectors. These effects vary depending on the particular parasite and pollutant that interact. Second, habitat alterations such as impounding water or development can  affect both intermediate host and vector populations such that the abundance of their attendant parasites is either increased or reduced. Third, fisheries can impact populations already stressed by disease. However, they may act to lower the density of a host population below the threshold for sustained transmission to such an extent that the parasite population can no longer persist. Fourth, introduced species may introduce new diseases to susceptible native populations or they may gain an advantage if they invade without the parasites from their native range. The complexity and ubiquity of these interactions are good arguments for considering parasitism when evaluating stressors of aquatic systems.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Mathematical model for the biodegradation of VOCs in trickle bed biofilters.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The objective of this work is to develop a fundamental mathematical model that describes the biodegradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in gas phase trickle-bed biofilters, and to estimate the unknown model parameters. The mathematical model considers a three-phase system (biofilm, water, and gas phase), non-uniform bacterial population, and one limiting substrate. Two pilot-scale trickle-bed biofilters were operated to remove the VOC diethyl ether from a waste gas stream. Experimental results from this system were used to estimate the unknown parameters of the steady-state model: the maximum rate of substrate utilization mum Xf, the Monod constant, Ks, and the ether biofilm/water diffusivity ratio, rd. While the value of mum Xf/Y was uniquely determined, the values of Ks and rd, were highly correlated. High values of the Monod constant and the ether diffusivity in the biofilm g ave similar predictions to those corresponding to low values of both parameters. Batch studies were used to estimate the value of Ks without mass transfer limitations showing that Ks &lt; 1 mg/L=2.6 mg COD/L. Using this information and biofilter operating data the true values of Ks and rd were determined.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>A unified approach to risk assessment for cancer and noncancer endpoints based on benchmark doses and uncertainty-safety factors.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  A fundamental goal of toxicology is to determine safe levels of human exposure to toxic substances. In the absence of information to establish dose-response relationships at low exposure levels generally experienced by humans, high-dose to low-dose linear extrapolation is generally used for estimating carcinogenic risks and the no-observed-adverse-effect-level divided by uncertainty (safety) factors is widely used for establishing human exposure guidelines for noncancer effects. The basis and impact of this dichotomy is examined and questioned. It is proposed that a unified approach be adopted for establishing human exposure guidelines for both cancer and noncancer endpoints. It is suggested that a lower confidence limit on the dose estimated to produce an excess incidence of adverse health effects in 10% of the individuals in a human study or 10% of the animals in laboratory experiments  be used as a point-of-departure. This dose would be divided by appropriate uncertainty factors to establish human exposure guidelines. For severe irreversible adverse health effects we suggest a total default uncertainty factor (divisor) for animal data on the order of 10,000, which is comparable to current guidelines. For reversible biological effects a smaller default uncertainty factor on the order of 1000 may be employed. This is comparable to the divisor often used currently when the point-of-departure is the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level. It is asserted that the toxicological information generally available does not warrant numerical estimates of risk at low levels of human exposure. Rather, we support a unified approach for all adverse health effects of dividing a benchmark dose by appropriate uncertainty factors to establish guidelines for human exposures to toxic substan ces.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Pesticides and Parkinson's disease.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Epidemiological studies and case reports provide evidence for an association between Parkinson's disease and past exposure to pesticides. Susceptibility to the effects of pesticides and other putative neurotoxins depends on variability in xenobiotic metabolism possibly generated by genetic polymorphisms, aging and variation in exposure to environmental agents including pesticides. The simplest mechanistic hypothesis for the association of pesticides with Parkinson's disease is that pesticides or their metabolites are directly toxic to mitochondria, although modulation of xenobiotic metabolism by pesticides provides an adjunct or alternative hypothesis.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Anergy and cytokine-mediated suppression as distinct superantigen-induced tolerance mechanisms in vivo.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Recombinant-activating gene 2 (RAG-2-/-) T cell receptor-transgenic mice repeatedly injected with the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A entered a tolerant state in which splenic CD4+ T cells produced little interleukin (IL)-2, interferon gamma, or IL-4. This state resulted from a combination of both clonal anergy and cytokine-mediated immunosuppression. The anergy persisted for at least 3 wk and could be distinguished from the suppression by a decrease in IL-2 production per cell, a block in the activation of early response kinases, and a failure to be reversed with anti-transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. Full suppression lasted for only 1 wk and involved both IL-10 and TGF-beta, but required additional unknown molecules for optimal effect. These experiments show that complex in vivo interactions of multiple peripheral tolerance mechanisms can now be dissected at both the cellular and  molecular levels.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Gas chromatographic flow method for the preconcentration and simultaneous determination of antioxidant and preservative additives in fatty foods.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  A partially automated gas chromatographic method for the simultaneous determination of antioxidants (tert.-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole, 2,6-di-tert.-butyl-p-hydroxytoluene, tert.-butylhydroquinone, alpha-tocopherol and alpha-tocopheryl acetate) and preservatives (sorbic acid, benzoic acid and their esters) in fatty foods without derivatization is reported. About 95% of triglycerides from lipid material are avoided by manually extracting the samples with a mixture of solvents and the remaining by using a continuous solid-phase extraction system. By using aqueous sample solutions (in 0.1 M HNO3), XAD-2 sorbent and selective elution with 200 mul of 2-propanol, only ca. 0.03% of total triglycerides present in the original sample remains in the final extract. Manual injection of the extract into a GC-flame ionization detection allows the additives to be determine at concentrations in the range 0.5-100 mug/m l with a high precision (ca. 3%). Mass spectrometry in the conventional electron impact mode, in conjunction with library search, permits the unequivocal identification of all the additives. Margarine, oil, cheese, pate and sauce samples were analysed in this way, all with good results.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Organochlorine and polychlorinated biphenyl contamination in black neck stilt, Himantopus mexicanus, eggs from the Savannah and Tybee National Wildlife Refuges.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Since previous studies had determined organic contamination in Savannah Harbor sediments, an assessment was needed to determine its potential effects on wildlife species which frequently used surrounding areas as feeding and breeding habitats. Ninety percent of the black neck stilt egg contents evaluated contained p,p'-DDE, and 14% of the egg contents contained more than one PCB congener. Ninety percent of chorioallantoic membranes evaluated contained p,p'-DDE. Data from this study will provide information necessary to evaluate proposed measures to enhance bird use of confined disposal facilities associated with Savannah Harbor and will serve as a baseline for future ecotoxicological information gathered to better manage bird nesting areas along the Atlantic coast.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Monitoring priority pollutants in the Yanghe River by dichloromethane extraction and semipermeable membrane device (SPMD).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Traditional dichloromethane extraction and semipermeable membrane devices containing triolein (triolein-SPMD) were used to monitor the presence and concentrations of priority organic pollutants in the Yanghe River. Qualitatively, both approaches give similar information on the types of priority pollutants in this river. After concentrated by SPMD for 28 days, analysis of priority pollutants is more feasible, time-integrative, and the data reflect the bioavailability. Assuming their concentrations in water were relatively stable during sampling period, it is possible to estimate concentrations for most of chemicals with log Ktw larger than 3 by the measured concentrations in triolein. But it is difficult to estimate concentrations for chemicals with log Ktw less than 3. Also, we reported for the first time the field mean Rss and their variances for individual PCB congener and the concentr ation distribution of priority pollutants in the river.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Slow pyrolysis of willow (Salix) studied with GC-MS and GC-FTIR-FID.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Small samples (15-150 mg) of wood and bark from basket willow (Salix viminalis) clone Jorr were pyrolysed at 550&amp;#176;C. Samples from pure wood of European White (Silver) Birch (Betula pendula (alba)) and Norway Spruce (Picea abies) were used as references. The compounds produced during pyrolysis were analysed using gas chromatographic (GC) methods: direct injection with GC/FID, direct injection with GC/MS, and pre-concentration with GC/MS. The samples from salix, birch and spruce all produced a range of low molecular weight compounds: aliphatic acids, esters, aldehydes, and ketones as well as furans. Commonly, these samples also formed aromatic compounds: phenol, methyl-phenols, and the guiacol (2-Methoxyphenol) series of compounds. Salix and birch both produced the syringol (2,6-Dimethoxyphenol) series of compounds. Syringol derivatives were not detected from the pyrolysis of spruce.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Two-generation reproductive toxicity study of plant stanol esters in rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Plant stanol esters are intended for use as an ingredient in food to reduce the absorption of cholesterol from the gastrointestinal tract. Consumption of plant stanol esters has a demonstrated diet-derived public health benefit, as shown by numerous clinical studies. Plant stanol esters are ring-saturated analogs of common dietary sterols that are transesterified with fatty acids from vegetable oils such as canola oil. The reproductive and developmental toxicity of plant stanol esters was investigated in male and female Wistar rats during F0 and F1 generations using dietary concentrations of 1.75, 4.38, and 8.76% stanol esters (equivalent to 1, 2.5, and 5% total stanols). No adverse treatment-related effects were noted on reproductive performance of male or female rats in any dose group. Increased food consumption was observed in high-dose F0 generation males throughout the entire premat ing period and in F1 males at specific time periods during the premating period. This increase in food consumption was also observed in F0 generation females (mid- and high-dose groups) and F1 generation females (low-, mid-, and high-dose groups) at specific time periods throughout the 10-week premating period. At different intervals throughout the gestation and lactation periods, increased food consumption was observed in F0 generation females of the mid- and high-dose groups, while increased food consumption was noted in F1 generation females of the mid- and high-dose groups during gestation, but not during lactation. Such increases in food consumption are expected as a result of the animals' attempt to compensate for the reduced caloric value of the test diet compared to controls. No adverse developmental effects were noted in F1 or F2 pups of the low- and mid-dose groups based on eva luation of the following parameters: litter size, pup mortality, pups weights, and sex ratio. However, a treatment-related effect on body weight and body weight change was observed in bothF1 and F2 male and female pups of the high-dose group, particularly during the latter stages of lactation (postnatal days 14 and 21) in F1 pups, and during the majority of the lactation period (postnatal days 4-21). Lower body weight in the high-dose pups is attributed to a reduction in the caloric value of the test diet compared to control. The pups, unlike adult animals, are particularly sensitive to reductions in caloric value of feed since they are in a rapid growth phase of their development. It is likely that they could not increase their food consumption enough to adequately meet their caloric and nutritional needs. In conclusion, dietary concentrations of up to 4.38% plant stanol esters (equival ent to 2.5% total stanols in the diet) are not associated with adverse effects on reproduction, pup mortality, pup body weight, or pup body weight change.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Current status of sport fish consumption advisories for PCBs in the Great Lakes.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  During the past two decades, there have been a number of efforts to harmonize the advice given by different jurisdictions to consumers of sport-caught fish from the Great Lakes. Five years ago, an eight-state task force arrived at consensus recommendations with respect to fish consumption advisories for PCB-contaminated fish from these bodies of water. This report will examine the impacts of these efforts on advisories in these eight states and also how these state advisories compare to that of the Province of Ontario which shares some of these Great Lakes. Careful analyses of the differences among jurisdictions in recommendations and in the bases for these recommendations will illustrate the difficulties in achieving complete consensus. It will be shown that there are a large number of choices that must be made in developing an advisory and that these choices depend largely on policy co nsiderations rather than science. Examples of these policy choices include whether to adjust measured fish concentrations for PCB losses due to preparation and cooking and whether to adjust PCB concentrations to account for nonfish sources of PCBs. Considering the variations among jurisdictions with respect to managing the risks from contaminants in various environmental media, it appears unlikely that uniformity can be achieved unless a regional rather than a state by state approach is taken. Whether a regional or a state by state approach is taken, the information in this report can be used to structure the fish consumption advisory decision-making process.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Rapid evaluation of biocidal activity using a transposon-encoded catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from pseudomonas putida.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Pseudomonas putida (UWC1), containing a genetically-engineered plasmid (pQM899), that encodes for the production of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C230), was used as a potential means of rapidly estimating bactericidal activity of chlorhexidine diacetate (CHA), phenol, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) and phenylmercuric nitrate (PMN). Enzyme C230 converts catechol to 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (2-HMS), which is yellow in colour, via a meta cleavage pathway. Ideal conditions for production and measurement spectrophotometrically of 2-HMS were determined. However, the correlation between this method and viable plate counts was not sufficiently accurate to enable 2-HMS production to provide a sufficiently sensitive determination of biocidal activity. An alternative method, synchronous scanning fluorimetry, in which the decrease in catechol concentration was measured under standardized conditions , provided a good dose-response histogram for all the biocides tested. Although, in comparison with plate counts, there was an underestimation of the bactericidal effects of phenol and PMN, the results of this study suggest that this method has potential in determining the bactericidal efficacy of agents such as CHA and CPC.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Haemolytic-uraemic syndrome caused by Vero toxin-producing Escherichia coli serotype rough: K-: H49.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The first case of haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS) caused by Vero toxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) which belonged to a novel serotype, Rough: K-: H49, is reported. The case was initially diagnosed as nephropathia epidemica caused by Puumala virus, but the subsequent diagnosis of HUS caused by VTEC was made after bacteriological investigation. The strain isolated fermented sorbitol produced VT2 toxin but not enterohaemolysin, nor did it carry the eaeA gene. In VTEC strains, the O antigen, the eaeA gene and enterohaemolysin production have been characterized as virulence-associated factors and believed to have an effect on pathogenesis of these strains to cause haemorrhagic colitis or HUS. The findings of this study demonstrate that there is a need for further studies to evaluate the pathogenetic mechanism of VTEC and need for easy diagnostic methods exploiting other properties tha n O157 antigen and non-fermentation of sorbitol to find all VTEC in human infections.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Mutations of loop 2 and loop 3 residues in domain II of Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1C delta-endotoxin affect insecticidal specificity and initial binding to Spodoptera littoralis and Aedes aegypti midgut membranes.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Site-directed mutagenesis was used to examine the role of predicted loops 2(374QPWP377) and 3 (436QRSGTPF442) in domain II of the Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1C delta endotoxin for insecticidal specificity and receptor binding. Q374E, S438F, and G439A substitutions resulted in near or complete loss of toxicity toward both Spodoptera littoralis and Aedes aegypti. R437K, R437I, and G439V mutants exhibited significantly reduced toxicity to S. littoralis and A. aegypti, while mutations of T440, P441, and F442 showed only slight reductions in toxicity to both insects. Loop 2 mutations Q374N, P375A, W376Y, and P377A did not significantly affect S. littoralis toxicity but exhibited reduced activity to A. aegypti. In contrast, the loop 3 mutations Q436K, Q436E, and S438Y had no effect on A. aegypti toxicity, but showed significantly decreased S. littoralis activity. Heterologous competition binding as says with brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) from both insects correlated well with the toxicity data with the exception of the R437 mutants, where steps other than initial receptor binding appear to be involved. Overall we conclude that, while loops 2 and 3 play an important role in binding and toxicity to both insects, loop 2 appears to play the greater role in A. aegypti activity, while loop 3 is more important for S. littoralis toxicity.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Gamma radiation doses for preventing pupariation and adult emergence of Rhagoletis mendax (Diptera: Tephritidae).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Blueberry maggot, Rhagoletis mendax Curran, eggs and larvae infesting highbush 'Bluecrop' and 'Elizabeth' blueberries, Vaccinium corymbosum L. (Ericaceae), were treated with 4-1200 Gy of gamma radiation. The treatment reduced the number of immature stages that pupated and the number of adults that emerged from puparia. The lethal dose for 99.9968% mortality (LD 99.9968%) (lower and upper fiducial limits (FL)) estimated by linear regression analysis to stop pupariation was 1486 (1400-1585) Gy, at the 95% confidence level. The LD 99.99968% (lower and upper FL) estimated to stop flies emerging from puparia irradiated as immature stages was 88 (83-93) Gy, at the 95% confidence level as estimated by regression analysis. An estimated 100 762 larvae were killed, with no survivors, by irradiating 853 918 'Bluecrop' blueberries in bulk quantities with 71-776 Gy with a commercial irradiator. No fl ies or parasites emerged from puparia irradiated as larvae with \71 and &gt;80 Gy using commercial and research irradiators, respectively. Infestation rate of blueberry maggot larvae in nonirradiated 'Bluecrop' and 'Elizabeth' blueberries averaged 11.1 | 1.2% and 14.3 | 2.4%, respectively; the range of infestation rate was from 6.3% to 14.8% and 9.8% to 18%, respectively. Parasitism of blueberry maggot larvae by the larval-puparial parasite, Diachasmimorpha (Opius) mellea (Gahan) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), averaged 10.1 | 2.4% (range 3-13.3%).</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Determination of solanidine- and tomatidine-type glycoalkaloid aglycons by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  A combined derivatization method for gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric (GC) analysis of steroidal glycoalkaloid (SGA) aglycons was developed using both trimethylsilylation and pentafluoropropionylation. In comparison with underivatized or only silylated aglycons, the new technique produces more specific and abundant fragmentation for compounds with a tomatidine-type structure. For example, the difference between solasodine and tomatidine, the former containing a double bond at position 5,6 in the steroidal skeleton, can be observed by their base peak fragments at m/z 417 (C24H41O2Si2) and m/z 419 (C24H43O2Si2). The method is well suited for the simultaneous determination of both solanidane- and spirosolane-type SGA aglycons from Solanum species and hybrids. The reproducibility of the method, including SGA extraction, hydrolysis, derivatization, and quantitative GC/MS analysis, wa s &lt;6% (CV) for the principal aglycons determined from a hybrid between a wild potato species, Solanum brevidens Phil., and a cultivated potato, S. tuberosum L. A single ion monitoring technique using specific fragments m/z 419 and 417 could be applied for the determination of minor stereoisomers, which are often overlapped by large amounts of tomatidine./CHEMISTRY</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Hydrogen peroxide induces oxidative DNA damage in rat type II pulmonary epithelial cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Type II epithelial cells, which line the alveolar surface of the lung, are exposed to a variety of potentially mutagenic and carcinogenic insults. The purpose of this study was to determine if type II cells are susceptible to oxidative DNA damage in vitro. Treatment of cultured rat type II lung epithelial cells with hydrogen peroxide led to increased concentrations (nmol/mg DNA) of 12 of 14 monitored DNA base modifications, suggesting oxidative damage by the hydroxyl radical. These base modifications are typically associated with oxidative stress, and elevated levels have been correlated with mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. These data demonstrate that type II cells are indeed vulnerable to oxidative DNA damage.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Inhibition of nitric oxide production rescues LPS-induced fetal abortion in mice.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  In this report, we examined the involvement of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-10 as well as nitric oxide (NO) in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced experimental abortion model in BALB/c mice. Although in vivo administration of LPS in pregnant mice showed a 72% decrease of serum IL-10, no significant difference in serum TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-4 levels, compared to controls, could be detected. At the same time, a correlation of fetal abortion and maternal splenomegaly with an important increase of NO synthesis in the serum was obtained. Simultaneous administration of LPS and aminoguanidine (AG; an inhibitor to NO synthase) rescued the LPS-induced fetal abortion, reduced maternal spleen weight to physiological levels, and decreased serum NO concentration to control levels. In vitro experiments showed that LPS directly induced NO p roduction in primary placental cells and the TPOPHO-1 trophoblast cell line by stimulating the inducible isoform of NO synthase, which ultimately could be blocked by the NO synthase inhibitors AG and L-NAME. The results indicate that LPS, despite its beneficial involvement in intracellular infections, participates in inflammatory/autoimmune damage during pregnancy, leading to embryotoxicity, which is closely linked to the NO pathway.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Suppression of toxin production in Clostridium difficile VPI 10463 by amino acids.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The impact of various growth conditions on the expression of toxins and other proteins by Clostridium difficile VPI 10463 was studied. During non-starved conditions, the rate of toxin synthesis paralleled that of total protein during both exponential growth and stationary phase, and in both defined and complex media. Biotin limitation reduced growth rate and bulk protein synthesis, whereas toxin expression continued, leading to a 50- to 200-fold increase in intracellular toxin levels. Concomitantly, several 22 kDa proteins were up-regulated as revealed by two-dimensional PAGE analysis. The toxin yield was 30-fold higher in peptone yeast extract (PY) than in PY containing glucose (PYG). By contrast, glucose limitation reduced toxin yields by 20- to 100-fold in defined media. By elevating the buffering capacity and bicarbonate concentration, toxin yields were increased by 10-fold in PY and  PYG. The high toxin production by C. difficile during growth in PY was lowered 100-fold by adding a blend of nine amino acids and several 60-100 kDa proteins were concomitantly down-regulated. It was concluded that toxin expression in C. difficile VPI 10463 was not affected by growth rate, growth phase, catabolite repression or the stringent response. Instead the co-expression of toxins and a few specific additional proteins appeared to be influenced by metabolic pathways involving CO2 assimilation, carboxylation reactions and metabolism of certain amino acids.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Participation of ABH glycoconjugates in the secretory response to Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin in rabbit intestine.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The ability of membrane ABH blood group-active glycoconjugates to act as receptors of the heat-labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli (LTh) was studied in vitro and in vivo when GM1 was blocked by the cholera toxin B subunit. Rabbits were classified as AB or H based on intestinal ABH-antigenic activities. Brush border membranes from AB rabbits contained 4 times more LTh binding sites than the H ones. LTh interaction could be inhibited by lectins that recognize ABH determinants. LTh induced a similar dose-dependent secretory response in ligated ileal loops of both types of animals. Anti-AB antibodies and Ulex europaeus I lectin could significantly reduce the fluid accumulation in AB and H rabbits, respectively. LTh caused adenylate cyclase activation even when GM1 was blocked, and this effect was abolished by the addition of specific ABH ligands. These results suggest that ABH glycoconjug ates are involved in the host secretory response to LTh in rabbit intestine.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Multiple roles of ligand in transforming the dioxin receptor to an active basic helix-loop-helix-PAS transcription factor complex with the nuclear protein Arnt.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The dioxin receptor is a ligand-activated transcription factor belonging to an emerging class of basic helix-loop-helix proteins which show interaction with the molecular chaperone hsp90 in their latent states and require heterodimerization with a general cofactor, Arnt, to form active DNA binding complexes. Upon binding of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons typified by dioxin, the dioxin receptor translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to allow interaction with Arnt. Here we have bypassed the nuclear translocation step by creating a cell line which expresses a constitutively nuclear dioxin receptor, which we find remains in a latent form, demonstrating that ligand has functional roles beyond initiating nuclear import of the receptor. Treatment of the nuclear receptor with dioxin induces dimerization with Arnt to form an active transcription factor complex, while in stark contra st, treatment with the hsp90 ligand geldanamycin results in rapid degradation of the receptor. Inhibition of degradation by a proteasome inhibitor allowed geldanamycin to transform the nuclear dioxin receptor to a heterodimer with Arnt (DR-Arnt). Our results indicate that unchaperoned dioxin receptor is extremely labile and is consistent with a concerted nuclear mechanism for receptor activation whereby hsp90 is released from the ligand-bound dioxin receptor concomitant with Arnt dimerization. Strikingly, artificial transformation of the receptor by geldanamycin provided a DR-Arnt complex capable of binding DNA but incapable of stimulating transcription. Limited proteolysis of DR-Arnt heterodimers indicated different conformations for dioxin versus geldanamycin-transformed receptors. Our studies of intracellular dioxin receptor transformation indicate that ligand plays multiple mechanist ic roles during receptor activation, being important for nuclear translocation, transformation to an Arnt heterodimer, and maintenance of a structural integrity key for transcriptional activation.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Rapid DNA extraction methods and new primers for randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis of Giardia duodenalis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  A randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) procedure using simple genomic DNA preparation methods and newly designed primers was optimized for analyzing Giardia duodenalis strains. Genomic DNA was extracted from in vitro cultivated trophozoites by five freezing-thawing cycles or by sonic treatment. Compared to a conventional method involving proteinase K digestion and phenol extraction, both freezing-thawing and sonication were equally efficient, yet with the advantage of being much less time- and labor-intensive. Five of the 10 tested RAPD primers produced reproducible polymorphisms among five human origin G. duodenalis strains, and grouping of these strains based on RAPD profiles was in agreement among these primers. The consistent classification of two standard laboratory reference strains, Portland-1 and WB, in the same group confirmed previous results using other fingerprinting met hods, indicating that the reported simple DNA extraction methods and the selected primers are useful in RAPD for molecular characterization of G. duodenalis strains.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Phalaris angusta (Gramineae) causing neurological disease in cattle in the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Two outbreaks of spontaneous poisoning in cattle by Phalaris angusta Nees ex Trin.("aveia louca", "aveia de sangue") are reported in cattle. The outbreaks occurred in the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil, during the winters of 1993 and 1996. In both outbreaks the animals were held in paddocks where P. angusta was a prevalent forage. Clinical signs in affected cattle included generalized tremors, alertness, hypermetria, ataxia and convulsions. Gross lesions were restricted to the brain and consisted of gray to greenish discoloration in the thalamus and mesencephalon. The disease was experimentally reproduced in cattle by administration of P. angusta.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>What is inherited in the predisposition toward alcoholism? A proposed model.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Background: The etiological factors associated with the predisposition to develop alcohol dependence remain largely unknown. In recent years, neurophysiological anomalies have been identified in young and adult offspring of alcoholic probands. These neuroelectric features have been replicated in several laboratories across many different countries and are observed in male and female alcoholics and some of their relatives and offspring. Moreover, these electrophysiological abnormalities are heritable and predictive of future alcohol abuse or dependence. Methods: A model is presented which hypothesizes that the genetic predisposition to develop alcoholism involves an initial state of central nervous system (CNS) disinhibition/hyperexcitability. We propose that the event-related brain potential (ERP) anomalies reflect CNS disinhibition. This homeostatic imbalance results in excess levels of  CNS excitability which are temporarily alleviated by the ingestion of alcohol. It is hypothesized that this hyperexcitability is heritable, and is critically involved in the predisposition toward alcoholism and the development of dependence. A brief review of the relevant literature is presented. Results: Neurophysiological, neurochemical, and genetic evidence support the proposed model. In addition, strikingly similar observations between animal research and the human condition are identified. Finally, it is asserted that the proposed model is primarily biological in nature, and therefore does not account for the entire clinical variance. Conclusion: A putative CNS homeostatic imbalance is noted as a critical state of hyperexcitability. This hyperexcitability represents a parsimonious model of what is inherited in the predisposition to develop alcoholism. It is our hope that this model  will have heuristic value, resulting in the elucidation of etiological factors involved in alcohol dependence.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Humoral versus neural pathways for fever production in rats after administration of lipopolysaccharide.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Background: These studies address the question of the relative roles of humoral and neural pathways in the genesis and control of the fever component of the acute phase response. Methods: Two experiments were performed to examine the effect of vagotomy (VagX) on the febrile response to intraperitoneal (i.p.) and intra-arterial (i.a.) lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and plasma cytokine and LPS concentrations after intravenous (i.v.) or i.p. injections of LPS. In experiment 1, body temperature (TB) was obtained from unperturbed animals by using radio transmitters and telemetry after injection of LPS i.a. or i.p. In the second study, serial blood samples were obtained for cytokine and LPS assay after injection of LPS either i.v. or i.p. Colonic temperatures (TC) were obtained from indwelling thermistors. Results: The maximal increments in TB for animals receiving LPS i.a. and i.p. with or without  VagX were not different from one another: sham vagotomy (Sham-VagX) + LPS i.a., 1.20 | 0.26&amp;#176;C;VagX + LPS i.a., 1.23 | 0.64&amp;#176;C; Sham-VagX + LPS i.p., 1.45 | 0.27&amp;#176;C; VagX + LPS i.p., 1.50 | 0.35&amp;#176;C (F = 1.12, p = 0.36). Neither were the four resulting response curves for TB different from one another. Plasma levels of LPS, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6 were significantly elevated at 45 minutes after LPS injection by either the i.v. or i.p. routes, preceding any increments in TB, and were not effected by VagX. Conclusion: Fever development for animals receiving LPS in experiment 1 demonstrates a temporal relationship -with increments in plasma levels of LPS and pyrogenic cytokines obtained in experiment 2 after administration of LPS either i.p. or i.v. Vagotomy had no discernible effect on the responses regardless of the route of administration of LPS.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Effect of dietary supplementation of vitamin E in partial inhibition of Russell's viper venom phospholipase A2 induced hepatocellular and microsomal membrane damage in rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The current investigation furnishes a good correlation between the alpha-tocopherol content of the liver and microsomes and corresponding inhibition of Russell's viper venom phospholipase A2 inflicted damage to them. Dietary supplementation of d1-alpha-tocopherol at a concentration of 100 mg and 200 mg per kg of diet displayed less damage caused by venom phospholipase A2 in sharp contrast to the vitamin E deficient rats. alpha-tocopherol due presumably to the formation of complexes with the phospholipid hydrolysis products of the membranes, plays a significant role in membrane stabilization.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Identification of the receptor for Bacillus sphaericus crystal toxin in the brush border membrane of the mosquito Culex pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The binary toxin (Bin) from Bacillus sphaericus crystals specifically binds to soluble midgut brush border membrane proteins from Culex pipiens larvae. A single 60 kDa midgut membrane protein is identified as the binding protein. This protein is anchored in the mosquito midgut membrane via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, and is partially released by phosphatidylinositol specific-phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Fractionation of soluble proteins by anion exchange chromatography indicates that the binding protein does not co-elute with leucine aminopeptidase activity. After partial purification, the sequences of internal amino acid fragments of the 60 kDa protein were determined. The peptide sequences were compared with data in GenBank, and showed a very high degree of similarity with enzymes belonging to the alpha-amylase family. Further enzymatic investigation showed that the receptor  of the Bin toxin in C. pipiens larval midgut may be an alpha-glucosidase.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Role of estradiol receptor-alpha in differential expression of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-inducible genes in the RL95-2 and KLE human endometrial cancer cell lines.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The present study was conducted to investigate the mechanism of the response of human uterine endometrial carcinoma cells, RL95-2 and KLE, to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). RL95-2 cells were highly responsive to TCDD in terms of cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1), cytochrome P4501B1 (CYP1B1), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2), whereas KLE cells showed little stimulatory effects only at high doses. Neither showed any growth inhibition upon exposure to TCDD. KLE cells expressed higher levels of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) than RL95-2 and gel mobility shift assay also identified more liganded AhR-ARNT complex bound to xenobiotic response elements (XRE). TCDD had no down-regulatory effects on the expression of either AhR or the estradiol receptor (ER). Though both cell types expressed ER-alpha almost equally, immunofluorescence demonstrated a defect in its nuclear transloca tion in KLE cells where ER-alpha was mainly cytoplasmic and estradiol-17beta (E2) was unable to translocate it to the nucleus. However, both cells were nonresponsive to E2 in terms of transcriptional activation and transient expression of normal ER-alpha restored the E2 responsiveness. Transient expression of ER-alpha in KLE cells also restored its responsiveness to TCDD on transcriptional activation. Collectively, these results indicate that ER-alpha acts as a positive modulator in regulation of the TCDD-inducible genes.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Disruption of six Saccharomyces cerevisiae novel genes and phenotypic analysis of the deletants.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  As a part of the EUROFAN programme, six open reading frames from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (YNL083w, YNL086w, YNL087w, YNL097c, YDL100c and YOR086c) were disrupted in two genetic backgrounds, FY1679 and W303. Individual deletions in diploid strains and tetrad analysis of heterozygous deletants revealed that none of them is essential. Basic phenotypic analysis did not reveal any significant difference between the parental and mutant strains. Although YNL087w and YOR086c are 55% identical, the double disruptant also behaves the same as the parental cells. Yd1100p seems to be involved in metal detoxification, the phenotype of the null mutants being enhanced when the assays are performed at 37&amp;#176;C.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Delayed vascular injury after single high-dose irradiation in the rat brain: Histologic, immunohistochemical, and angiographic studies.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  PURPOSE: To investigate structural and functional changes in rats after focal brain irradiation by using histologic, immunohistochemical, and angiographic methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty rats were irradiated stereotactically with photons from a 15-MeV linear accelerator. Two collimators and single doses ranging from 20 to 100 Gy were used to treat stereotactically defined areas of 3.7- and 4.7-mm cross section (80% isodose) in the right frontal lobe. The dose-response relationship for the end-point necrosis at 19 months revealed a mean tolerance dose (D50) of 34.2 Gy (standard errors: +4.1, -3.7 Gy). Histologic, immunohistochemical, and angiographic examinations were performed to evaluate delayed radiation effects. RESULTS: All animals irradiated with 100 Gy developed radiation necrosis after 9 months. Microangiography and immunohistochemical fluorescence staining of the endothelia l cells revealed dose-dependent vascular dilatation and rarefaction. Animals irradiated with 20-50Gy showed no morphologic changes after 9 months. With irradiation of 30-50 Gy, histologic vascular changes that increased with dose were found after 19 months. At that time, no changes were detected after irradiation with 20 Gy with both field sizes and after irradiation with 30 Gy and the 2-mm collimator. Radiation-induced functional disturbances of the brain vasculature could be demonstrated by extravasation of contrast medium by using a microangiographic technique. CONCLUSION: The observed effect had a definite dependence on dose, volume, and time after treatment.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>The disulfide-coupled folding pathway of apamin as derived from diselenide-quenched analogs and intermediates.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The sequence of apamin, an 18 residue bee venom toxin, encloses all the information required for the correct disulfide-coupled folding into the cystine-stabilized alpha-helical motif. Three apamin analogs, each containing a pair of selenocysteine residues replacing the related cysteines, were synthesized to mimic the three possible apamin isomers with two crossed, parallel, or consecutive disulfides, respectively. Refolding experiments clearly revealed that the redox potential of selenocysteine prevails over the sequence encoded structural information for proper folding of apamin. Thus, selenocysteine can be used as a new device to generate productive and nonproductive folding intermediates of peptides and proteins. In fact, disulfides are selectively reduced in presence of the diselenide and the conformational features derived from these intermediates as well as from the three-dimensional ( 3D) structures of the selenocysteine-containing analogs with their nonnatural networks of diselenide/disulfide bridges allowed to gain further insight into the subtle driving forces for the correct folding of apamin that mainly derive from local conformational preferences.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>No effect of loss of E2F1 on liver regeneration or hepatocarcinogenesis in C57BL-6J or C3H-HeJ mice.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The E2F family of transcription factors regulates the expression of genes needed for DNA synthesis and cell-cycle control. However, the individual contributions of the different E2F family members in regulating proliferation in various tissues have not been well characterized. Mouse liver is an excellent system for investigating proliferation because its growth state can be experimentally manipulated. As observed in cell culture systems, E2F1 protein is present at low levels in the quiescent liver, with an increase in expression during proliferation. Therefore, we expected that E2F1 may play an important role in cell-growth control during periods of robust proliferation. Using E2F1-nullizygous mice, we performed partial hepatectomies to investigate the role of E2F1 in the synchronous proliferation of adult hepatocytes. We found that E2F1 deficiency resulted in only minor changes in gene  expression and that the timing of liver regeneration was not altered in E2F1 nullizygous mice. E2F1has displayed properties of both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene in different model systems. Therefore, we investigated the role of E2F1 in rapidly growing liver tumor cells in strains of mice that have high (C3HeJ) and low (C57BL/6J) rates of hepatocarcinogenesis. We observed no significant differences in the number of liver tumors that developed after diethylnitrosamine treatment of wild type versus E2F1-nullizygous mice. We suggest that abundant levels of E2F4 in the mouse liver compensate for loss of E2F1.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Mutational status of the p53 gene modulates the basal level of jun N-terminal kinase and its inducibility by ultraviolet irradiation in A1-5 rat fibroblasts.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Exposure of mammalian cells to ultraviolet (UV) light and other DNA-damaging agents triggers the UV response which is characterized by induction of a large number of genes including c-fos, c-jun, and the genes for DNA repair enzymes and cell-cycle regulatory proteins such as p21 WAF1 and p53. Upon DNA damage, the p53 tumor suppressor protein transmits signals to restrict cell-cycle progression, thereby allowing time for DNA repair to occur. Cells also respond to genotoxic stress by activation of the jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase pathway. In this report we investigated the effects of modulation of the level of wild-type and mutant p53 protein on basal and UV-inducible JNK activity. We used the A1-5 rat fibroblast cell line, which contains a p53 gene coding for a temperature-sensitive p53 protein, which allows us to regulate the relative level of wild-type and  mutant p53 protein produced in a cell. We measured the relative levels of JNK activity in sham-irradiated and UV-irradiated cells by using the immune complex kinase assay and then computed the fold induction of JNK after UV exposure. We demonstrated that cells expressing p53 protein in the wild-type conformation (when grown at 32&amp;#176;C) exhibited a very low level of JNK activity that was induced 14- to 16-fold by UVC irradiation. When cells were grown at 37&amp;#176;C or 39&amp;#176;C to express predominantly mutant p53 protein, basal JNK activity was significantly higher than at 32&amp;#176;C. UVC irradiation of cells expressing mutant p53 protein resulted in JNK activation, although the overall fold-induction was only two-fold because JNK1 activity was already high in the sham-treated controls. UVB irradiation also induced JNK1 activity, although we again observed a relatively high level of basal JNK activity in sh am-irradiated cells expressing mutant p53 protein compared with cells expressing wild-type p53. Control experiments confirmed that JNK1 basal activity was not affected by temperature alone. Western blot analysis of cell extracts indicated that expression of p21 WAF protein was significantly higher in cells expressing wild-type p53 protein and was associated with low basal levels of JNK1 activity. In contrast, cells expressing mutant p53 protein and very low levels of p21 WAF1 protein were found to have a higher level of basal JNK1 activity. We also observed a reduced ability to induce JNK1 after UV irradiation of several other cell lines with p53-mutant or p53-null genotypes. Our results provide evidence for a novel connection between p53 status and the basal level of JNK1, a critical enzyme in the stress-activated protein kinase family. In addition, these studies suggest that the presen ce of mutant p53 protein in a cell not only affects basal activity of JNK1 but also affects the ability of a cell to respond to UV-induced stress by transmitting signals via induction or activation of the JNK1 cascade.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>On the diversity and heterogeneity of H-2d-restricted determinants and T cell epitopes from the major bee venom allergen.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  One of the main limitations of using synthetic peptides for immunotherapy in allergic patients is the difficulty to delineate the immunodominant T cell epitopes which are necessarily dependent on HLA molecules. We have thus addressed the question of the role of MHC II molecules in immunodominant epitopes selection in the particular case of the major bee venom allergen (API m1). To exhaustively and easily explore it, we used BALB/c mice whose H-2 haplotype is associated with high IgE and IgG responses to API m1. By means of extensive sets of synthetic peptides, we investigated the specificity of polyclonal T cells and monoclonal hybridomas from mice immunized with API m1 and delineated four immunodominant regions, restricted to either the I-Ed or the I-Ad molecule. All the peptides were also tested for their capacity to bind to immunopurified MHC II molecules. Eight determinants of high a ffinity were identified. They clustered into three distinct regions and were largely overlapping.They included all the immunodominant epitopes, but half of them were not capable of stimulating T cells. Strikingly, interacting surfaces with either the TCR or MHC II molecule greatly differed from one determinant to another. In one case, we observed that flanking regions exerted a particular action on T cell stimulation which prevented the fine epitope localization. Our results underline the diversity and complexity of MHC II-restricted determinants and T cell epitopes from the major bee venom allergen, even in a single haplotype. These data also participate in the development of alternative approaches to conventional immunotherapy.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Electrophoretic monitoring of pollutants: Effect of cations and organic compounds on protein interactions monitored by native gel electrophoresis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  We describe how the interaction between actin and its protein ligands can be used to evaluate the presence of certain metal (Cd, Cu, Hg, Zn) ions and organic compounds (2,4-dioxin or Picloram) which are common components of environmental pollution. The assay detects the high-affinity binding of actin to actin-binding proteins (ABPs), cofilin or DNase I. The actin-ABP complex was analyzed using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified by scanning densitometry. These proteins are widely distributed in animals and plant cells. The assay involves allowing the proteins to form an actin-ABP complex into which increasing amounts of pollutants are titrated. Thus, the assay directly tests for inhibition of protein-protein interaction. It is sensitive to common pollutants using concentration ranges over which they are known to exert a biological toxicity. A convenient feature of th e assay is the fact that all the proteins can be stored in freeze-dried form, and can be purchased commercially. We suggest that if this molecular assay is sensitive to a wide range of environmental pollutants, it could be used as a rapid and convenient assay of the environment in combination with currently available tests.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Design and use of redox-recyclable organometallic extractants for the cationic radionuclides 137Cs+ and 90Sr2+ from waste solutions.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Two new redox-active organometallic extractants for the redox-recyclable extraction and recovery (R2ER) of the cationic radionuclides 137Cs+ and 90Sr2+ from aqueous waste simulants, Na(Fe(eta5-C5H5)(eta5-(3)-1,2-C2B9H9(n-C12H25)2)) (Na+I-) and Na(Fe(eta5-C5H5)(eta5-(3)-1,2-C2B9H7(n-C12H25)2-9,12-Br2)) (Na+II-), were synthesized and investigated. When diluted with toluene or xylenes, they extracted Cs+ from aqueous waste simulants such as (i) 1 mol L-1 NaOH + 1 mol L-1 NaNO3, (ii) 1 mol L-1 HNO3, and/or (iii) 1 mol L-1 NaCl, with D(Cs) values that ranged from 5 to 20; the corresponding D(Sr) values were | 0.04. The addition of poly(ethylene glycol) as a co-diluent increased D(Sr) values to as high as 33 but decreased D(Cs) values by a factor of 2-10, depending on conditions. When separated from the raffinate and exposed to air, the extractant-containing organic phase released \88% of its radioact ivity in the form of a solid precipitate of minimal volume. When a small amount of water was present during this procedure, the extractant-containing organic phase released \99% of its radioactivity to the new aqueous phase. When an oxidized dilute extractant was rereduced and used for a second R2ER cycle, the D(Cs) value was unchanged.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Reduction of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans in contaminated muds by mechanically induced combustion reactions.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Some selected results are reported from an ongoing study concerning mechanochemical dehalogenation reactions carried out under autopropagating high-temperature regimes. Our work shows that instantaneous burning reactions can be ignited in highly exothermic systems involving chloroorganics when subjected to intensive mechanical treatments. A reference trial using calcium hydride-hexachlorobenzene is first presented. No residual traces of the organohalide compound were found in the reacted powders or in the gaseous phase sampled from the headspace of the milling reactor. The solid products of the reaction were restricted to CaHCl and CaCl2 salts and graphite. Similar combustion-like phenomena were observed when contaminated mud samples were added to initial reactants. The contaminated mud was obtained from a waste site and contained traces of polychlorodibenzodioxins and polychlorodibenzof urans. It was observed that an effective chemical oven was created which caused the thermochemicalbreakdown of the hazardous compounds. A transformation yield greater than 99.6% was obtained with a decrease of the toxic equivalent concentration from 2492 to 0.788 mug/kg. Unlike conventional incineration methods, the mechanically induced burst processes run under a strictly confined environment and controlled conditions.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Spectroscopic confirmation of uranium(VI)-carbonato adsorption complexes on hematite.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Evaluating societal risks posed by uranium contamination from waste management facilities, mining sites, and heavy industry requires knowledge about uranium transport in groundwater, often the most significant pathway of exposure to humans. It has been proposed that uranium mobility in aquifers may be controlled by adsorption of U(VI) carbonato complexes on oxide minerals. The existence of such complexes has not been demonstrated, and little is known about their compositions and reaction stoichiometries. We have used attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopies to probe the existence, structures, and compositions of  FeOsurface-U(VI) carbonato complexes on hematite throughout the pH range of uranyl uptake under conditions relevant to aquifers. U(VI) carbonato complexes were found to be the predomina nt adsorbed U(VI) species at all pH values examined, a much wider pH range than previously postulated based on analogy to aqueous U(VI) carbonato complexes, which are trace constituents at pH &lt; 6. This result indicates the inadequacy of the common modeling assumption that the compositions and predominance of adsorbed species can be inferred from aqueous species. By extension, adsorbed carbonato complexes may be of major importance to the groundwater transport of similar actinide contaminants such as neptunium and plutonium.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Speciation of subsurface contaminants by cone penetrometry gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  A thermal extraction cone penetrometry gas chromatography/mass spectrometry system (TECP GC) has been developed to detect subsurface contaminants in situ. The TECP can collect soil-bound organics up to depths of 30 m. In contrast to traditional cone penetrometer sample collectors, the TECP extracts organics from soil without bringing the soil to the surface or into a collection chamber. Results show that polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), chlorinated pesticides, and explosives can be recovered (60-95%) from wet or dry soil, with extraction efficiency compound-specific. The data are in remarkable agreement with closed cell thermal desorption (TD) experiments, where no organics are lost to the environment during heating. TECP GC/MS results also compare favorably with solvent-extracted GC/MS analyses and can be used to delineate the presence and extent of  contamination at hazardous waste sites. Data illustrating TECP dependence on probe temperature andsoil moisture as well as carrier gas linear velocity and volume (modified Reynolds number) are shown along with sample analysis data from two hazardous waste sites. The total ion and reconstructed ion current chromatograms are shown for PAHs collected by TECP from a coal tar contaminated soil obtained at a manufactured gas plant in Massachusetts. TECP and TD results are within 15% for nonvolatile PAHs and within 50% of the solvent-extracted data./METHODS</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Toxicokinetics and bioconcentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in freshwater isopods.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  A novel method based on a first-order two-compartment model was used to determine the bioconcentration and toxicokinetic rate constants of six different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the freshwater isopod Asellus aquaticus, a common species in most European freshwater systems. Numerical integration and iterative parameter estimation techniques were applied to account for time-varying aqueous exposure concentrations. All PAHs exhibited a rapid uptake. Monophasic elimination patterns were observed for benzo(e)pyrene and benzo(a)-pyrene (biological half-life t0.5: 7-8 days). For the other PAHs (anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrene, benzo(ghi)perylene) typical biphasic patterns were encountered with rapidly (t0.5: 0.6-2 days) and slowly (t0.5: 99 to &gt; 1000 days) exchanging compartments. Some PAHs (pyrene and benzo(ghi)-perylene) will hardly be eliminated during the normal life span  of the organism. Bioconcentration factors (log BCF, wet weight; derived from rate constants) increased with molecular weight and Kow (n-octanol/water partition coefficient) from 2.6 L kg-1 (anthracene) to 5.7 L kg-1 (benzo(ghi)perylene). A linear relationship was observed between log BCF and log Kow. It is argued that biotransformation of PAHs in freshwater isopods seems to play a minor role and that this species may be suitable for the assessment of the bioavailability of PAHs in littoral freshwater environments.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Incremental aerosol reactivity: Application to aromatic and biogenic hydrocarbons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The concept of incremental aerosol reactivity is introduced, and the incremental aerosol reactivities of a number of important anthropogenic and biogenic hydrocarbons are investigated for four ambient scenarios. The incremental aerosol reactivity, defined as a change in the secondary organic aerosol mass produced (in mug m-3) per unit change of parent organic reacted (in ppb), is a measure of the aerosol-forming capability of a given parent organic in a prescribed mixture of other organic compounds. The base-case scenario is a mixture of both aromatic and biogenic organics. Reactivity values depend on the choice of the initial organic mixture, so cases are also examined in which all biogenic hydrocarbon concentrations are set to zero and all aromatic concentrations are set to zero. The influence of additional organic aerosol is also investigated. For the compounds studied, incremental aer osol reactivities range from 0.228 mug m-3 ppb-1 (m-xylene) to 10.352 mug m-3 ppb-1 (alpha-humulene) for the base case, from 0.234 mug m-3 ppb-1 (m-xylene) to 9.446 mug m-3 ppb-1 (alpha-humulene) for the base case in the presence of initial organic aerosol, from 0.133 mug m-3 ppb-1 (m-xylene) to 0.801 mug m-3 ppb-1 (diethylbenzene) for the zero-biogenic case, and from 0.456 mug m-3 ppb-1 (linalool) to 6.923 mug m-3 ppb-1 (alpha-humulene) for the zero-aromatic case. Using m-xylene as a basis, relative incremental aerosol reactivities range from 1.153 (low-yield aromatics) to 3.338 (diethylbenzene) for aromatics in the base case and from 1.349 (low-yield aromatics) to 6.032 (diethylbenzene) in the zero-biogenic case. Using alpha-pinene as a basis, relative incremental aerosol reactivities range from 0.569 (terpinolene) to 12.843 (alpha-humulene) for biogenics in the base case and from 0.882 (linalool) to 13.385 (alpha-hu mulene) in the zero-aromatic case.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Soil acidification in southern Switzerland between 1987 and 1997: A case study based on the critical load concept.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Southern Switzerland with its mainly acidic bedrock is potentially very sensitive to the effects of atmospheric proton input. In addition, this region suffers from relatively high acid deposition originating from the greater Milano area. The soil solution composition at different depths of a cryptopodzolic soil was monitored over a 10 year period with samples collected fortnightly. On the basis of the concept of critical loads of acidity, the molar ratio of base nutrient cations (BC) to aluminum was used as the parameter to assess acidification. Despite characteristic seasonal short-term variations of BC and Al, which could be attributed qualitatively to specific soil chemical processes, statistically significant trends over the entire observation period were observed. In all horizons a depletion of BC concentrations indicated an impoverishment of the nutrient status of the vegetation. A luminum decreased in the upper soil, whereas a significant increase was observed at the lowest soildepth. The BCl ratio decreased significantly in all mineral soil horizons, indicating rapid soil acidification. Considering the constant decrease of acid deposition at the site during the observation period with values significantly below calculated critical loads, the observed acidification is attributed to a memory effect of the high acid loads between 1965 and 1985.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Detection of high molecular weight organic tracers in vegetation smoke samples by high-temperature gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  High-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography (HTGC) is an established technique for the separation of complex mixtures of high molecular weight (HMW) compounds which do not elute when analyzed on conventional GC columns. The combination of this technique with mass spectrometry (i.e., HTGC-MS) is not so common and application to aerosols is novel. The HTGC and HTGC-MS analyses of smoke samples taken by particle filtration from combustion of different species of plants provided the characterization of various classes of HMW compounds reported to occur for the first time in emissions from biomass burning. Among these components are a series of wax esters (long chain alcohols esterified with long chain fatty acids) with up to 58 carbon numbers, aliphatic hydrocarbons (C15-C40; Cmax = C31; odd predominance), triglycerides, long chain methyl ketones (up to 37 carbons; Cmax = C33; odd pr edominance), alkanols (up to 40 carbons; Cmax = C32; even predominance), and a series of triterpenyl fatty acid esters (e.g., alpha- and beta-amyryl stearate) which have been characterized as novel natural products. Long chain fatty acids with more than 32 carbon numbers are not present in the smoke samples analyzed. The HMW compounds in smoke samples from the burning of plants from Amazonia indicate the input of directly volatilized natural products in the original plants during their combustion. However, the major organic compounds extracted from smoke consist of a series of lower molecular weight polar components, which are not natural products but the result of the thermal breakdown of cellulose and lignin. In contrast, the HMW natural products may be suitable tracers for specific sources of vegetation combustion because they are emitted as particles without thermal alteration in the smoke  and can thus be related directly to the original plant material.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Volatilization of chemicals from tap water to indoor air from contaminated water used for showering.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) may enter indoor air during the use of contaminated tap water. When this occurs, occupants can become exposed to potentially toxic VOCs via the inhalation route. The propensity for VOCs to volatilize into indoor air during the routine use of showers was investigated. A series of mass transfer experiments were conducted while a shower was operated within an enclosed chamber. Acetone, ethyl acetate, toluene, ethylbenzene, and cyclohexane were used as volatile tracers. Chemical-specific stripping efficiencies and mass transfer coefficients were determined. An assessment of the importance of gas-phase resistance to mass transfer from water to air was also completed. Chemical-specific stripping efficiencies ranged from 6.3% (for acetone) to 80% (for cyclohexane) for household showers used under normal conditions. As described in this paper, data resulting fro m this study allow for the determination of overall mass transfer coefficients, and corresponding volatilization rates, for any showering event and chemical of interest. As such, the information presented herein should lead to improved estimates of human inhalation exposure to toxic chemicals that volatilize from water to indoor air.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Sequence of expression of MyoD1 and various cell surface and cytoskeletal proteins in regenerating mouse muscle fibers following treatment with sodium dihydrogen phosphate.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  An immunohistochemical study was performed in order to evaluate the sequence of expression of various cell surface proteins (neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and its polysialylated isoform, PSA NCAM, and utrophin), cytoskeletal proteins (myosin heavy chain isoforms, desmin) and the transcription factor MyoD1 in regenerating mouse muscle fibers following treatment with sodium dihydrogen phosphate. The sequence of the regeneration process with this new myotoxic agent is similar to that which can be observed with other myotoxic substances (local anaesthetics such as bupivacaine or snake venoms). The results show that NCAM, PSA NCAM and desmin were already present on the first day after injury in the presumptive myoblasts. The highest level of all of these proteins was observed on the third day. At this stage, regenerating muscle fibers also strongly and diffusely expressed myosin heavy  chain isoforms and utrophin throughout their sarcolemma, whereas MyoD1 expression was observed inthe regenerating myonuclei. PSA NCAM and MyoD1 had gradually disappeared from the muscle fibers by the seventh day, by which time, the expression of the other developmentally regulated proteins had also decreased. On the 21st day after injury, a few fibers still expressed NCAM but not the other proteins. This study first shows that sodium dihydrogen phosphate is a new myotoxic agent that is cheap, widely available and easy to handle. It also establishes the schedule of expression of various developmentally regulated proteins in regenerating mouse muscle fibers.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Toxicological and antioxidant effects of short-term dehydroepiandrosterone injection in young rats fed diets deficient or adequate in vitamin E.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  This study examined the in vivo antioxidant and/or prooxidant effect of short-term dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) injection and the effect of dietary vitamin E. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (4 wk old) were fed vitamin E-deficient or vitamin E-adequate (30 mg DL-alpha-tocopheryl acetate/kg) diet for 4 weeks followed by intraperitoneal injection of DHEA for 1 week. The results showed that DHEA injection caused a dose-dependent decrease in body weight, and this effect was more pronounced in vitamin E-deficient rats. In contrast, DHEA injection significantly increased liver, kidney and adrenal weights. Hepatic vitamin E content was significantly lowered by vitamin E deficiency, which led to significantly increased ex vivo and iron-induced lipid peroxidation. DHEA injection did not affect hepatic vitamin E content but significantly decreased ex vivo and iron-induced lipid peroxidation in vitamin E-def icient rats. Hepatic total sulfhydryl (SH) groups and non-protein SH contents were not affected by vitamin E but were significantly increased by DHEA injection, which at 100 mg/kg was not more effective than at 50 mg/kg. Hepatic glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity was significantly decreased by DHEA, but vitamin E alleviated such a decrease. DHEA injection significantly increased hepatic glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity, and the effect was dose dependent in vitamin E-deficient rats. Thus, DHEA may compensate for vitamin E deficiency in vivo, and this effect is masked when dietary vitamin E is adequate. The antioxidant effect of DHEA is accompanied by decreased body weights, enlarged (fat-laden) tissues and altered activities of hepatic GST and G6PD.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Glutathione counteracts the inhibitory effect induced by cadmium on photosynthetic process in soybean.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  In soybean seedlings, Cd2+ affected growth and inhibited photosynthesis. Both the length and fresh mass decreased more in roots than in shoots. Cd2+ stress caused an increase in ratio of chlorophyll (Chl) (a+b)/b by 1.3 fold and ratio of total xanthophylls/beta-carotene by 3 fold compared to the control. A reduced activity of photosystem 2 by about 85 % measured in Cd2+-treated chloroplasts was associated with a dramatic quenching of fluorescence emission intensity, with a band shift of 4 nm. A major suppression of absorption was accompanied with shift in peaks in the visible region of the spectrum. In Cd2+-treated chloroplasts a selective decline in linolenic acid (18:3), the most unsaturated fatty acid of chloroplasts, paralleled with the ten fold enhancement in ethylene production. A three fold increase in peroxidase activity was found in chloroplasts treated with Cd2+ compared to the co ntrol. Addition of 1 mM glutathione (GSH) counteracted all the retardation effects insoybean seedling growth induced by Cd2+. Thus GSH may control the Cd2+ growth inhibition as it detoxifies Cd2+ by reducing its concentration in the cytoplasm and removing hydrogen peroxide generated in chloroplasts.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>A multiplex-PCR-RFLP procedure for simultaneous CYP2E1, mEH and GSTM1 genotyping.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Inter-individual variation in metabolism of environmental toxicants, which is attributed to genetic polymorphism, may be a major risk factor in determining who will develop adverse health effects. This priority research area is the focus of many laboratories, and new techniques need to be developed to enhance the efficiency in generating data. We have developed and validated a new multiplex-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) procedure for simultaneous genotyping of cytochrome P450 II E1 (CYP2E1), microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH), and glutathione S-transferase mu (GSTM1). Enzymes from these three polymorphic genes are involved with the phase I and II metabolism of a variety of environmental toxicants. Therefore, simultaneous characterization of these genes will not only reduce costs but will increase the efficiency of data collection, thereb y contributing to health risk assessment efforts.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Properties of ultraviolet irradiated protein films.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Protein-based films were cast from film-forming solutions of wheat gluten, corn zein, egg albumin, and sodium caseinate. Control and ultraviolet (UV) irradiated (253.7 nm, 51.8 J/m2) films were evaluated for tensile strength, total soluble matter, water vapor permeability, and Hunter L, a, and b color values. UV treatment increased tensile strength of gluten, zein, and albumin films suggesting the occurrence of UV radiation-induced cross-linking within film structures. For caseinate films, UV-curing did not affect tensile strength but substantially reduced total soluble matter. Small but significant decreases in total soluble matter also were noticed for UV-treated zein and albumin films. UV irradiation reduced water vapor permeability of albumin films but did not affect water vapor permeability of the other types of films. Gluten, albumin, and caseinate films had increased yellowness as  a result of UV treatment. In contrast, UV treatment decreased the yellowness of zein films, possibly due to destruction of zein pigments by UV radiation.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Effects of sodium alginate and fish oil to reduce trichloroethylene accumulation in rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  This study was conducted to examine the effect of dietary sodium alginate and fish oil on bodily accumulated trichloroethylene (TCE), which has been widely used as a halogenated solvent and is metabolized at a high rate. Each of three groups of rats was fed on either of diets containing cellulose-soybean oil (control), Na-alginate-soybean oil or cellulose-fish oil for 3 wk, and thereafter given a single oral dose of TCE (100 mg (0.76 mmol)/rat). TCE levels in the blood were monitored for 10 h after the administration of TCE. The peak concentrations of TCE in the blood tended to be higher in the alginate and fish oil groups as compared with those in the cellulose-soybean oil group, but not to a significant extent. TCE concentrations in the liver, kidney, brain and the three fat tissues (epididymal, perirenal and subcutaneous) were significantly lower in the alginate and fish oil groups th an in the cellulose-soybean oil group. Fat tissue weights were also lower in the alginate group and fish oil group. The hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes could not account for the remarkable decreases of residual TCE contents in the alginate and fish oil groups. These findings indicate that the metabolism and excretion of TCE might be accelerated in animals with reduced fat tissue mass.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Identification of functional domains of Bordetella dermonecrotizing toxin.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Bordetella dermonecrotizing toxin (DNT) stimulates the assembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions by deamidating Gln63 of the small GTPase Rho. To clarify the functional and structural organization of DNT, we cloned and sequenced the DNT gene and examined the functions of various DNT mutants. Our analyses of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences revealed that the start codon of the DNT gene is a GTG triplet located 39 bp upstream of the reported putative initiation ATG codon; consequently, DNT contains an additional 13 amino acids at its N-terminal end. All of the N-terminally truncated mutants were found to modify Rho. The shortest fragment of DNT possessing the Rho modification activity consists of amino acids from Ile1176 to the C-terminal end. This fragment overlaps the region homologous to Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factors (CNFs), which show activity similar  to that of DNT. The introduction of a mutation at Cys1305 located in the highly conserved regionbetween CNFs and DNT eliminated the activity, indicating that this domain is the catalytic center of DNT. The N-terminal fragment (1 to 531) of DNT failed to modify Rho but reduced the DNT-induced polynucleation in MC3T3-E1 cells when simultaneously added with the holotoxin, suggesting competitive inhibition in the receptor-binding or internalizing step. Our finding that DNT consists of an N-terminal receptor-binding and/or internalizing domain and a C-terminal catalytically active domain may facilitate analysis of the overall action of the toxin on the mammalian target cells.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>The protective effect of breast feeding in relation to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS): III. Detection of IgA antibodies in human milk that bind to bacterial toxins implicated in SIDS.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Two toxin-producing bacteria implicated in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) are Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens. Epidemiological studies have shown that breast feeding reduces an infant's risk of SIDS. This protective effect could be due partly to IgA antibodies to these toxins in human milk. The aim of this work was to use a quantitative ELISA to determine levels of IgA antibodies that bound to toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST-1), staphylococcal enterotoxin C (SEC) and C. perfringens enterotoxin A (CEA) in individual samples of human milk. All samples of milk tested contained IgA antibodies that bound to the bacterial toxins. For individual samples, IgA bound to TSST-1, SEC and CEA were in the range of 900-3100 ng ml-1, 1000-3600 ng ml-1 and 1000-4300 ng ml-1 respectively. Isolation of S. aureus from mothers donating breast milk samples was used to determine if the  presence of bacteria affected IgA levels which bound TSST-1 and SEC. For 3/5 samples with levels above the upper limit of the standard deviation (2375 ng ml-1) for IgA bound to TSST-1, S. aureus was isolated from the mother whilst 4/5 samples found to contain levels above the upper limit of the standard deviation (2627 ng ml-1) for IgA bound to SEC, had S. aureus isolated from the mother. In conclusion, if bacterial toxins do play a role in precipitating a SIDS death, the presence of IgA antibodies to toxins in breast milk, but not in infant formula, might contribute to the protective effect of breast feeding in relation to SIDS.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>The protective effect of breast feeding in relation to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS): II. The effect of human milk and infant formula preparations on binding of Clostridium perfringens to epithelial cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Breast feeding is known to protect an infant against gastrointestinal pathogens and epidemiological studies indicate that compared to breast fed infants, formula fed infants are at a greater risk of dying from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Many SIDS infants have symptoms of gastrointestinal infections prior to death and one gastrointestinal pathogen associated with SIDS is Clostridium perfringens. Studies have found that a significantly higher number of formula fed SIDS infants have C. perfringens and its enterotoxin in their faeces compared to breast fed infants. The aim of the study was to compare the effects of human milk and infant formula on binding of C. perfringens to epithelial cells. Two protocols were used to assess the effect of human milk and infant formula to inhibit binding of C. perfringens to epithelial cells. Binding was assessed by flow cytometry. For the in vivo  protocol which more closely represents interactions on the mucosal surface, breast milk enhanced bacterial binding but infant formula caused inhibition of binding; however for the in vitro method, both human milk and infant formula resulted in consistent enhancement of binding. Flow cytometry studies indicated that enhancement of binding was due to the formation of bacterial aggregates. Lewisa and Lewisb antigens, found in both breast milk and infant formula, inhibited C. perfringens binding in a dose dependent manner. The Lewisa and Lewisb antigens in human milk and infant formula can inhibit C. perfringens binding to epithelial cells. While infant formula reduced binding of C. perfringens to epithelial cells in the experiments carried out with the in vivo protocol, the protective effects of breast feeding in relation to colonisation with C. perfringens are more likely to be due to for mation of bacterial aggregates. These findings have implications for improving infant formula preparations.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Endotoxin in blood and tissue in the sudden infant death syndrome.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Although the explanation for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) remains unknown, an increasing body of evidence now exists to suggest a possible role for bacterial toxins in the aetiology, and a number of investigators have considered that endotoxaemia could explain some of the associated features. Following the development of an animal model which confirmed that endotoxaemia could be detected after death, we studied endotoxin levels in blood and tissue samples taken at autopsy from SIDS infants, child controls and adult controls. There were significant correlations between endotoxin levels in blood and the various organs sampled particularly in SIDS cases and child controls, and blood endotoxin levels in SIDS cases were higher in those infants where there was histological evidence of mild to moderate inflammation. However, overall no significant differences were found between endotoxin  levels in blood or tissue in the three study groups. Further studies into possible actions or interactions of endotoxin in SIDS are required.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Translocation of the catalytic domain of diphtheria toxin across planar phospholipid bilayers by its own T domain.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The T domain of diphtheria toxin is known to participate in the pH-dependent translocation of the catalytic C domain of the toxin across the endosomal membrane, but how it does so, and whether cellular proteins are also required for this process, remain unknown. Here, we report results showing that the T domain alone is capable of translocating the entire C domain across model, planar phospholipid bilayers in the absence of other proteins. The T domain therefore contains the entire molecular machinery for mediating transfer of the catalytic domain of diphtheria toxin across membranes.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Peroxisome-proliferator regulates key enzymes of the tryptophan-NAD+ pathway.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Structually diverse peroxisome-proliferators (PPs) were investigated regarding their effects on NAD+ level and two key enzyme activities in the tryptophan (Trp)-NAD+ pathway in the liver of rats (Sprague-Dawley male) fed PP-containing diets freely for 2 weeks. All PPs, except for thyroxine, significantly increased hepatic NAD+ level in concert with hepatic hypertrophy. Activity of quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QAPRTase), one of the key enzymes in the Trp-NAD+ pathway, was increased by the PPs which caused significant increase in the hepatic NAD+. On the other hand, alpha-amino-beta-carboxymuconate-epsilon-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSDase), another key enzyme in the Trp-NAD+ pathway, was drastically inhibited by all PPs except for linolenic acid, which was only slightly inhibitory. Most PPs investigated activated peroxisomal marker enzymes such as palmitoyl-CoA oxidase, catalase, and PPAR -alpha(peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor-alpha)-dependent enzymes, such as malic enzymeand L-3-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase. NAD+ was also increased in the rat hepatocytes cultured in the medium supplemented with PPs. These data suggested that regulation of the key enzymes in the Trp-NAD+ pathway was associated with PPAR-alpha directly or indirectly, and as a consequence the hepatic NAD+ was increased by PPs.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Effects of tachykinin NK1 or PAF receptor blockade on the lung injury induced by scorpion venom in rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  In cases of severe human scorpion envenoming, lung injury is a common finding and frequently the cause of death. In the rat, two distinct mechanisms account for oedema following the intravenous injection of the venomte left ventricular failure resulting from a massive release of catecholamines and an increase in pulmonary vascular permeability. In the present work, we investigated the effects of a tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist (CP96,345, the dihydrochloride salt of (2S.3S)-cis-2-(diphenylmethyl)-N-((2-methoxyphenyl)methyl)-1-azabicycol(2.2.2)octan-3-amine) and its 2R-3R inactive enantiomer (CP96.344) on the acute lung injury induced by the i.v. injection of Tityus serrulatus venom in rats. Lung injury was assessed by evaluating the extravasation of Evans blue dye in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and in the lung of venom-treated and control animals. The effects of the platel et-activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonist WEB2170 (2-methyl-1-phenylimidazol(4,5c)pyridine) were evaluated for comparison. The i.v. injection of the venom induced the extravasation of Evans blue in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and into the left lung. Pretreatment with the tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist CP96,345, but not CP96,344, inhibited Evans blue dye extravasation in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and in the lung by 96% and 86%, respectively. The PAF receptor antagonist WEB2170 inhibited the increase in vascular permeability in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by 60% and had no effect on the extravasation to the lung parenchyma of venom-injected animals. In addition to abrogating lung injury, pretreatment of rats with CP96,345, but not CP96,344 or WEB2170, decreased by 70% the mortality induced by the venom. This is the first study to show the relevance of the tachykin in NK1 receptor in mediating lung injury and mortality in animals injected with the neurotoxic T. serrulatus venom. Blockade of the tachykinin NK1 receptor may represent an important strategy in the treatment of patients with signs of severe envenoming and clearly deserves further studies.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Outbreak of Escherichia coli O157 in a nursery: Lessons for prevention.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Objectives To identify risk factors for transmission of verocytotoxin producing Escherichia coli O157 (VTECO157) and means of prevention. Study design Outbreak investigation: retrospective cohort study. Setting A nursery (child care centre) in North Wales. Subjects Children attending (n = 104). Methods Faeces were examined using sorbitol MacConkey agar (SMAC), with cefixime, tellurite, and rhamnose; enrichment in modified tryptone soya broth; and immunomagnetic separation. Symptoms and exposure data were obtained from questionnaires to parents/guardians and children's toiletting and feeding records kept at the nursery. Main outcome measure A "case" was defined as a child with verocytotoxin producing E coli O157 isolated from faeces, or a history of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) and antibodies to E coli O157 lipopolysaccharide, during the period 10 August to 30 September 1995. Results  The attack rate was 31 in 104. Two children developed HUS. There were higherattack rates among girls and friends who played together. Cases were more likely to attend the nursery more frequently. The mean number of recorded bowel motions/child/half day was 0.51 in cases and 0.21 in well children. Child to staff ratios were high preceding and during the outbreak. Conclusions A sick child is the most plausible source of infection with subsequent person to person transmission. The record of children's toiletting discriminated between cases and well children and might have allowed earlier detection of the outbreak. This simple record could be considered by other child care facilities as a means of giving early warning of problems with infectious intestinal diseases.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Response of respiratory muscles to intravenous nicotine challenge in anaesthetized cats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The effects of an intravenous nicotine challenge on the ventilation and activity of rib cage muscles were studied in 33 pentobarbitone-chloralose anaesthetized cats. Bolus injection of nicotine (200 mug) into the right femoral vein evoked in 19 of the intact animals prompt, short-lived apnoea, or prolongation of the first expiration after the drug, the occurrence of which was significantly reduced by midcervical vagotomy (P &lt; 0.001). In breaths that followed the apnoea, peak activity of the parasternal intercostal muscles increased from a baseline of 3.1 | 0.8 to 9.2 | 1.8 arbitrary units (P &lt; 0.001). Nicotine produced a similar increase in peak phrenic ENG (7.0 | 0.5 to 14.5 | 1.2 arbitrary units; P &lt; 0.001). Peak triangularis sterni muscle EMG was reduced from 8.9 | 1.2 to 6 | 1.7 arbitrary units (P &lt; 0.05) and the onset of response was delayed to 30 s after the challenge. The changes o f respiratory effectors induced by nicotine were independent of vagal integrity. The results show that post-nicotine apnoea is to large extent vagally dependent though the response of the respiratory muscles is mediated by non-vagal influences.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Effect of organic amendments on seedling disease of tomato caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Six organic amendments namely, neemcake, pongamia cake, pongamia fresh and dry leaves, eucalyptus dry leaves and farm yard manure (FYM) were studied for their effect against seedling disease in tomato caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici at three concentrations and two incubation periods of decomposition in potculture under greenhouse conditions. As the concentration of amendments increased, healthy seedling stand also increased. In general, two week incubation period with 60% healthy seedlings was found superior to four week incubation period (59%). Irrespective of incubation periods and concentration of six organic amendments, FYM was found significantly superior to all others with 66% mean healthy seedlings followed by neem cake (61%) and pongamia fresh leaves (61%) FYM (2%) was significantly superior to all other amendments in both the incubation periods of decomposition, t wo weeks and four weeks with 71 and 71% healthy seedlings, respectively, followed by neem cake (0.15%) with 70% at two week incubation period and at 0.1% with 67% healthy seedlings at 4 week incubation period.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Manipulation of the tetrahydrocannabinol side chain delineates agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Structure-activity relation studies have established that the alkyl side chain in tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) plays a crucial role in the activation of the cannabinoid receptor. Unfortunately, the flexible nature of this side chain has hampered efforts to elucidate the precise nature of the interaction of THC with its receptors. Therefore, a series of analogs with structurally restrained side chains of varying length was synthesized and evaluated for pharmacological potency in mice and for receptor affinity. The introduction of cis double bonds inserted rigid angles, whereas triple bonds developed regions of planarity. Receptor affinity for the acetylenic and saturated side chains were the same, whereas double bond substitution increased affinity 10-fold. Moreover, the relationship between receptor affinity and potency was 10-fold less than that of DELTA8-THC in the case of some acetylenic de rivatives, whereas changing the triple bond to a double bond restored the potency/affinity ratio.Additionally, an acetylene at C2-C3 in the octyl and nonyl side chains favored antinociception by as much as 70-fold. Surprisingly, several high-affinity acetylenic derivatives, especially those with cyano substitutions at the terminus of the side chain, were partial agonists or were inactive. Some of these low-efficacy, high-affinity ligands elicited antagonistic activity. The finding that manipulations of the side chain produces high-affinity ligands with either antagonist, partial agonist, or full agonist effects reveals a critical structural feature for receptor activation.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>IkappaB kinase complex is an intracellular target for endotoxic lipopolysaccharide in human monocytic cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Endotoxic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a proinflammatory agonist produced by gram-negative bacteria and a contributor to the majority of the 400,000 septic shock cases recorded annually in US hospitals. The primary target cells for LPS are monocytes and macrophages. Their response consists of massive production of proinflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen- and nitrogen-intermediates, procoagulants, and cell adhesion molecules. In turn, expression of these LPS-responsive factors contributes to collapse of the circulatory system, to disseminated intravascular coagulation, and to a 30% mortality rate. A common intracellular mechanism responsible for the expression of septic shock genes in monocytes and macrophages involves the activation of NF-kappaB. This transcription factor is regulated by a family of structurally related inhibitors including IkappaBalpha, IkappaBbeta, and IkappaBepsilon, which trap NF-kappaB in the cyt oplasm. In this report, the investigators show that LPS derived from different gram-negativebacteria activates cytokine-responsive IkappaB kinases containing catalytic subunits termed IKKalpha (IKK1) and IKKbeta (IKK2). The kinetics of IKKalpha and IKKbeta activation in LPS-stimulated human monocytic cells differ from that recorded on their stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-alpha, thereby implying a distinct activation mechanism. LPS-activated IKK complexes phosphorylate all 3 inhibitors of NF-kappaB: IkappaBalpha, IkappaBbeta, and IkappaBepsilon. Moreover, LPS activates IKKbeta preferentially, relative to IKKalpha. Thus, IKK complex constitutes the main intracellular target for LPS-induced NF-kappaB signaling to the nucleus in human monocytic cells to activate genes responsible for septic shock.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Estrogenic potencies of several environmental pollutants, as determined by vitellogenin induction in a carp hepatocyte assay.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Estrogenic potencies of several xenoestrogens were determined in vitro, using cultured hepatocytes from a genetically uniform male carp strain (Cyprinus carpio). Estrogenicity was measured as induction of the yolk protein precursor vitellogenin (Vtg), and compared to Vtg induction by 17beta-estradiol (E2). The order of estrogenic potency was: methoxychlor (MXCL) &gt; o,p-DDT &gt; chlordeconentylphenol. Estrogenic potencies of these compounds varied from 1S had a relative estrogenic potency of 0.5, whereas dieldrin, beta-endosulfan, o,p-DDE, and toxaphene (technical mixture) did not induce vitellogenesis at concentrations up to 100 muM. Experiments in which cells were simultaneously exposed to E2 and these xenoestrogens showed that the Vtg-inducing activities of E2 and 4-t-pentylphenol or bisphenol-A were (partially) a dditive, whereas E2 antagonized the estrogenic effects of MXCL and o,p-DDT. Theeffect of cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A)-induction on the estrogenicity of MXCL was studied by co-exposing cells to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD (10 pM) caused a greater than 50-fold induction of CYP1A, measured as ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity, but Vtg induction by MXCL was not significantly affected. This indicates that CYP1A is not involved in the bioactivation of MXCL to more potent estrogenic metabolites in carp. The CARP-HEP (hepatocyte) assay can detect xenoestrogens with a potency \ 2ws simultaneous testing of more than 10 compounds for both estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects, which makes it a promising tool for the screening of suspected xenoestrogens.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>The single exposure carcinogen database: Assessing the circumstances under which a single exposure to a carcinogen can cause cancer.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  A relational retrieval database has been developed compiling toxicological studies that assess whether a single dose of a chemical or physical agent, without exogenous promotional stimuli, could cause tumor development in animal models. This database allows for an evaluation of these studies over numerous parameters important to tumor outcome, which include type and quality of the studies as well as physical/chemical properties of the agents. An assessment of the database, which currently contains approximately 5500 studies involving about 800 chemicals from 2000 articles, reveals that a single dose of an agent can cause tumors to develop in males and females of numerous animal models in all principal age groups. In addition, the range of the 426 agents causing a positive response is chemically diverse, with representatives from over several dozen chemical classes. The dose caused a tumo r endpoint was generally not acutely life threatening and was frequently a low proportion of the LD50 (i.e., less than 1/50 LD50). Positive responses also were reported via multiple routes of exposure, mainly oral, by injection, or dermal. These findings indicate that the phenomenon of single-exposure carcinogenesis is widespread and highly generalizable across chemical class, route, dose range, species, age, and gender. Single-exposure carcinogenesis, a concept long de-emphasized by regulatory agencies, requires a careful and formal consideration, especially as it may pertain to accidental spills, leaks, fires, explosions, and exposure excursions, but not necessarily limited to these.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Effect of varied fermentation periods on the diabetogenic potential of toasted cassava granules.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The effects of exclusive gari diets prepared using varied fermentation periods on the fasting blood glucose levels (FBGL) and glucose tolerance (GT) of rats were studied. Thirty growing male albino rats divided randomly into 5 groups of 6 rats each were used. The 5 groups were each fed gari diets fermented for 0, 24, 48, 72 hours; and a standard rat diet, respectively, for 8 weeks. Data on the total cyanogen content and % crude protein of the diets; FBGL, GT, body weight, water:feed consumption ratio and clinical observations of the rats were collected. Results showed that the total cyanogen content and % crude protein of the diets were depleted as fermentation periods increased. The FBGL of all the gari-fed rats were significantly elevated and their GT significantly impaired with a significant variation between the groups. The elevated FBGL and impaired GT which were found to increase w ith increase in fermentation period were strongly inversely correlated to the % crude protein content of the diets (r = -0.92 and -0.96 respectively) suggesting that the diabetogenic potential of gari diets strongly depended on its % crude protein content. Shortened fermentation periods leading to production of gari with high total cyanogen content did not induce higher diabetogenicity.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>A gas chromatography-electron capture-negative chemical ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry method for analysis of endogenous and exogenous N7-(2-hydroxyethyl)guanine in rodents and its potential for human biological monitoring.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  A gas chromatography/electron capture/negative chemical ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC/NCI-HRMS) method was developed for quantitating N7-(2-hydroxyethyl)-guanine (N7-HEG) with excellent sensitivity and specificity. (4,5,6,8-13C4)-N7-HEG was synthesized, characterized, and quantitated using HPLC/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS) so it could serve as an internal standard. After being converted to its corresponding xanthine and derivatized with pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) bromide twice, the PFB derivative of N7-HEG was characterized using GC/EC/NCI-HRMS carried out at full scan mode. The most abundant fragment was at m/z 555, with a molecular formula of C21H9N4O3F10, resulting from the loss of one PFB group. By monitoring m/z 555.0515 (analyte) and m/z 559.0649 (internal standard), this assay demonstrated a linear relationship over a range of 1 fmol t o 1 pmol of N7-HEG versus 20 fmol of (13C4)-N7-HEG on column. The limit of detection (LOD) for the complete assay was 600 amol (S/N = 5) injected on column. The variation of this assay was within 15% from 1 to 20 fmol of N7-HEG versus 2 fmol of (13C4)-N7-HEG with four replications for each calibration standard. Two hundred to three hundred micrograms of spleen DNA of control rats and mice and 100 mug of spleen DNA of rats and mice exposed to 3000 ppm ethylene for 6 h/day for 5 days were analyzed using GC/EC/NCI-HRMS. The amounts of N7-HEG varied from 0.2 to 0.3 pmol/mumol of guanine in tissues of control rats. Ethylene-exposed animals had 5-15-fold higher N7-HEG levels than controls. This assay was able to quantitate N7-HEG in 25-30 mug of DNA from human lymphocytes with excellent specificity. This was due in part to human tissues having 10-15-fold higher amounts of endogenous N7-HEG than r odents. These results show that this GC/EC/NCI-HRMS method is highly sensitive and specific and can be used in biological monitoring and molecular dosimetry and molecular epidemiology studies./ECONOMICS</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Alkylation of human serum albumin by sulfur mustard in vitro and in vivo: Mass spectrometric analysis of a cysteine adduct as a sensitive biomarker of exposure.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  To develop a mass spectrometric assay for the detection of sulfur mustard adducts with human serum albumin, the following steps were performed: quantitation of the binding of the agent to the protein by using (14C)sulfur mustard and analysis of acidic and tryptic digests of albumin from blood after exposure to sulfur mustard for identification of alkylation sites in the protein. The T5 fragment containing an alkylated cysteine could be detected in the tryptic digest with micro-LC/tandem MS analysis. Attempts to decrease the detection limit for in vitro exposure of human blood by analysis of the alkylated T5 fragment were not successful. After Pronase treatment of albumin, S-(2-((hydroxyethyl)thio)ethyl)Cys-Pro-Phe was analyzed by means of micro-LC/tandem MS, allowing a detection limit for in vitro exposure of human blood of 10 nM, which is 1 order of magnitude lower than that obtained by  means of modified Edman degradation. The analytical procedure could be successfully appliedto the analysis of albumin samples from Iranian victims of the Iran-Iraq war.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Vital cell labelling for the detection of invasive growth in the chick embryo skin invasion assay.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Of the various in vitro invasion assays described, only a few use tissues as substrates, for example, the chick heart fragment assay and the chick embryo skin (CES) invasion assay (Noguchi et al., 1978). We have improved culture conditions for the CES invasion assay (Schlage, 1989). A suspension of neoplastically transformed cells is incubated on an explanted piece of skin from a 9-10-day-old chick embryo. After 1, 2 and 3 days, the explants are fixed and cross-sectioned. As a measure of invasiveness, the number of invading cells and their mitotic activity should be evaluated. We tested the suitability of the vital fluorescence dye PKH-2 (Horan and Slezak, 1989) for improving discrimination between CES cells and invading cells; human cervical carcinoma (HeLa), 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA)-transformed mouse embryo fibroblasts (10T1/2-MCA7), and MNNG-transformed rat tracheal epithelial cells  (RTE-MNNG). The three cell lines formed distinct infiltrates on days 2 and 3, but on day 1, only 10T1/2-MCA7 and RTE-MNNG cells formed infiltrates. Although PKH-2 labelling was found suitable for the detection of invasion, cellular resolution and dye stability in cryosections is still unsatisfactory. To overcome this for routine work, we suggest improving the histological processing and using PKH-26, which is a more stable dye.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Imipramine for cytochrome P450 activity determination: A multiple-species metabolic probe.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Imipramine is metabolized in vitro by rat, mouse or human microsomes to several metabolites including 2-hydroxyimipramine, 2-hydroxydesipramine, desipramine, didesmethylimipramine and imipramine-N-oxide. Heat treatment (which inhibits FMO), verified the role of this group of enzymes in the oxidation of imipramine to imipramine N-oxide. These studies demonstrate that while rats and humans showed similar metabolic profiles, producing several minor metabolites in addition to the 2-hydroxyimipramne and desipramine, differences were seen in the mouse microsomes. In these samples, few minor metabolites were produced. In addition, imipramine N-oxide was the major metabolite in mouse, whereas none was detected in human samples. To conclude, the metabolic profile of imipramine can be used to reveal a number of cytochrome P450 enzymes active in microsomal fractions.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Purification, characterization, and amino acid sequence of cerato-platanin, a new phytotoxic protein from Ceratocystis fimbriata f. sp. platani.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  A new phytotoxic protein (cerato-platanin) of about 12.4 kDa has been identified in culture filtrates of the Ascomycete Ceratocystis fimbriata f. sp. platani, the causal agent of canker stain disease. The toxicity of the pure protein was bioassayed by detecting the inducing necrosis in tobacco leaves. The pure protein also elicited host synthesis of fluorescent substances in tobacco and plane (Platanus acerifolia) leaves. We purified the protein from culture medium to homogeneity. Its complete amino acid sequence was determined; this protein consists of 120 amino acid residues, contains 4 cysteines (S-S-bridged), and has a high percentage of hydrophobic residues. The molecular weight calculated from the amino acid sequence agrees with that determined by mass spectrometry, suggesting that no post-transnational modification occurs. Searches performed by the BLAST program in data banks (Swi ss-Prot, EBI, and GenBank ) revealed that this protein is highly homologous with two proteinsproduced by other Ascomycete fungi. One, produced during infection of wheat leaves, is codified by the snodprot1 gene of Phaeosphaeria nodorum (the causal agent of glume blotch of wheat), whereas the other is the rAsp f13 allergen from Aspergillus fumigatus. Furthermore, the N terminus of cerato-platanin is homologous with that of cerato-ulmin, a phytotoxic protein belonging to the hydrophobin family and produced by Ophiostoma (Ceratocystis) ulmi, a fungus responsible for Dutch elm disease.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Fixed location rain shelters for studying precipitation effects on rangelands.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Seasonal distribution of rainfall is thought to be important in structuring arid and semi-arid plant communities. Controlled studies of rainfall distribution have proven difficult, especially at the scale necessary to evaluate plant community changes. Simply comparing years with different rainfall distributions is problematic because rainfall amounts are seldom constant, and it is impossible to factor out other climatic variables (such as temperature). The AUs describe an approach for studying rainfall distribution using large (12 and water was applied to three zones within each of five individual rain shelters. The treatments applied to the watering zones were: (1) average precipitation distribution from long-term records (50% from November to March, 30% April to June, and 20% divided among July, August, and October); (2) s pring distribution (80% from April to July); and (3) winter distribution (80% from November to March). This approach allows for a comparison of treatments where only rainfall distribution is altered. Factors to consider in designing a study of this nature include: cost of structures and plot size necessary, quality of water to be applied to plots; differential animal use of treatments; and management of watering treatments.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Senescence-associated gene expression during ozone-induced leaf senescence in Arabidopsis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The expression patterns of senescence-related genes were determined during ozone (O3) exposure in Arabidopsis. Rosettes were treated with 0.15 muL L-1 O3 for 6 h d-1 for 14 d. O3-treated leaves began to yellow after 10 d of exposure, whereas yellowing was not apparent in control leaves until d 14. Transcript levels for eight of 12 senescence related genes characterized showed induction by O3. SAG13 (senescence-associated gene), SAG21, ERD1 (early responsive to dehydration), and BCB (blue copper-binding protein) were induced within 2 to 4 d of O3 treatment; SAG18, SAG20, and ACS6 (ACC synthase) were induced within 4 to 6 d; and CCH (copper chaperone) was induced within 6 to 8 d. In contrast, levels of photosynthetic gene transcripts, rbcS (small subunit of Rubisco) and cab (chlorophyll a/b-binding protein), declined after 6 d. Other markers of natural senescence, SAG12, SAG19, MT1 (metallo thionein), and Atgsr2 (glutamine synthetase), did not show enhanced transcript accumulation. When SAG12 promoter-GUS (beta-glucuronidase) and SAG13 promoter-GUS transgenic plants were treated with O3, GUS activity was induced in SAG13-GUS plants after 2 d but was not detected in SAG12-GUS plants. SAG13 promoter-driven GUS activity was located throughout O3-treated leaves, whereas control leaves generally showed activity along the margins. The acceleration of leaf senescence induced by O3 is a regulated event involving many genes associated with natural senescence.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Genetic linkage of HLA-class II locus to mite-specific IgE immune responsiveness.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Background IgE response to common inhalant allergens seems to be the major determinant of the development of atopic rhinitis and asthma but it has been difficult to demonstrate genetic control of the IgE response. Objective To investigate genetic linkage between specific IgE reactions to purified aeroallergens (grass, birch, cat, mite) and the HLA-class II locus. Methods DNA-based HLA-class II typing was performed for determination of DRB1, DQB1 and DPB1 alleles. Linkage was studied by the affected sibpair method and the extended transmission disequilibrium test in 100 children from 40 nuclear families selected from a homogeneous population in south-western Germany. Results Significant linkage of mite-specific IgE response to HLA-DPB (P = 0.00001), HLA-DRB (0.02) and HLA-DQB (P = 0.001) was revealed by sibpair analysis of MHC class II alleles and confirmed by the extended transmission di sequilibrium test for HLA-DRB (P = 0.01) and HLA-DPB (P = 0.04). No consistent significant linkage between the HLA-class II locus and IgE response to grass pollen, birch pollen, and cat dander could be demonstrated. Conclusion The findings are consistent with the existence of one or more genes in the HLA-class II region modifying the IgE immune response to common environmental allergens.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>A short composting method by the single phase composter for the production of oyster mushroom.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  A single phase composter was constructed by modifying the conventional mixer of sawdust for the cultivation of oyster mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus. The machine was designed on the basis of 3-phase-1 system which was controlled in prewetting, pasteurization and fermentation processes. In composting 200 kg of straw and cotton waste in the machine, it took 20 minutes in prewetting step and also 10 hours at 65&amp;#176;C in pasteurization process. Postfermentation by aerothermophiles was completed by treating the compost at 45&amp;#176;C-50&amp;#176;C for 48 hours which was shorten 24 hours from the conventional method. In the postfermentation at high temperature, forced aeration and/or vigorous mixing process(es) played a great role in the improvement of spawn quality. The growth of mycelium of oyster mushroom was excellent in the culture combinated with 3 parts of surface inoculation and 7 parts of mechanical mixing .</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Conformation of the diphtheria toxin T domain in membranes: A site-directed spin-labeling study of the TH8 helix and TL5 loop.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The isolated T domain of diphtheria toxin was mutated by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis at 28 consecutive sites (residues 328-355) that comprise the TH8 helix and the TL5 interhelical loop in the native toxin. After derivatizing the mutant proteins with a sulfhydryl-selective nitroxide reagent, we examined the mobility of each nitroxide and its accessibility to polar and nonpolar paramagnetic reagents, before and after insertion into phospholipid bilayers. The data obtained with the proteins in solution at pH 8 are generally consistent with predictions from the crystal structure of the toxin. Upon membrane binding at pH 4.6, a major structural reorganization of the domain was seen, which dramatically reduced the accessibility of most residues in this region to the polar reagent nickel(II)-ethylenediaminediacetate complex (NiEDDA). Many of these residues also showed reduced accessibility t o the nonpolar reagent O2. Periodic accessibility of the nitroxide side chains along the sequence to these reagents shows that TH8 remains largely helical in the membrane-bound state, with one surface associated with protein and the other facing the hydrophobic interior of the bilayer. In addition, the TL5 loop also appears to become alpha-helical in the membrane, with one surface in contact with protein and the other in contact with the bilayer interior. These findings provide a structural framework for understanding how the T domain forms a transmembrane channel and mediates translocation of diphtheria toxin's enzymic moiety across a membrane.</AbstractText>

Two variants of human class pi glutathione (GSH) S-transferase 1-1 with either isoleucine or valine in position 104 (hGSTP1-1(I104) and hGSTP1-1(V104)) have distinct activity toward (+)-anti-7,8-dihydroxy-9,10-oxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo(a)pyrene ((+)-anti-BPDE). To elucidate their structure-function relationship, we determined the crystal structures of the two variants in complex with GSBpd, the GSH conjugate of (+)-anti-BPDE, at 2.1 and 2.0. The crystal structures reveal that residue 104 in the xenobiotic substrate-binding site (H-site) dictates the binding modes of the product molecule GSBpd with the following three consequences. First, the distance between the hydroxyl group of Y7 and the sulfur atom of GSBpd is 5.9omplex versus 3.2roxyl groups of GSBpd forms a direct hydrogen bon d with R13 in hGSTP1-1(V104) GSBpd; in contrast, this hydrogen bondis not observed in the I104 complex. Third, in the hydrophilic portion of the H-site of the I104 complex, five H-site water molecules (Ji, X., et al. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 9690-9702) are observed, whereas in the V104 complex, two of the five have been displaced by the Bpd moiety of GSBpd. Although there is no direct hydrogen bond between Y108 (OH) and the hydroxyl groups of GSBpd, indirect hydrogen bonds mediated by water molecules are observed in both complexes, supporting the previously suggested role of the hydroxyl group of Y108 as an electrophilic participant in the addition of GSH to epoxides.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Seed dispersal and potential forest succession in abandoned agriculture in tropical Africa.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Natural forest succession on human-disturbed lands is often slow because the resources necessary for succession are depleted. In such landscapes, forest succession may be dependent on arrival of seeds from off-site, many of which are dispersed by fruit-eating animals. We studied bat and bird seed dispersal in a deforested agricultural area adjacent to Kibale National Park, Uganda. Seed rain was monitored for 6 mo in short (&lt;0.5 m) and tall (2-5 m) grassland, and below short (1-3.5 m), medium (3.5-10.0 m), and tall (\10.0 m) isolated trees within grassland. Seed rain (numbers of seeds and seed species) under trees of all heights was greater than in short or tall grasslands. Bats dispersed seeds mostly below tall trees, while birds dispersed seeds mostly below both tall and midsized trees. More seeds and seed species were dispersed under tall trees than below short trees. Within 150 m of t he forest there was no relationship between the seed rain under trees and the distance to the forest edge. Nearly half of the &gt;11 200 seeds collected were from hemiepiphytic Ficus that are unable to grow from the ground. One-third of collected seeds were from shrubs, and most of the remainder were from trees. Nearly all tree and shrub seeds collected (&gt;99%) were species typically found in disturbed grassland, not in forest. These results suggest that in this African region, forest succession may proceed very slowly on degraded lands.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Use of chicken egg-yolk antibodies against K88+ fimbrial antigen for quantitative analysis of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) K88+ by a sandwich ELISA.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  An enzyme-linked immunosorbent sandwich assay (ELISA) has been developed to detect and quantify both the K88+ fimbrial antigen and the concentration of bacterial cells in fecal and other samples using anti-fimbrial chicken egg-yolk and anti-fimbrial rabbit serum antibodies. The assay has a sensitivity of 40ng ml-1 for K88+ fimbrial antigen and 107 CFU ml-1 for intact cells and cell homogenate. The inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation (CV) for intact cells, homogenates, and fimbrial antigens were similar, suggesting that reproducible results can be obtained with any of the three preparations. In all cases the CV increased with decreasing concentration of the antigen, especially when very low concentrations of antigen were used. Fimbrial antigens had lower CV (values ranged from 2 to 37%, depending on its concentration) than standards prepared from either whole cells or homogen ized cells (values ranged from 1 to 67%). The correlation between the actual number of cells ascounted and the number as estimated from the ELISA using the amount of fimbrial antigen was r = 0.98, P &lt; 0.001. The anti-K88+ polyclonal antibodies from chicken serum and egg yolk had little or no cross-reactivity with K99, 987P ETEC. The correlation (r) between the fecal score for diarrhea and the number of E coli in the fecal swab was high, r = 0.80 (n = 64, P &lt; 0.0001). The assay is sensitive and specific and provides a good estimate of the amount of fimbrial protein or the number of K88+ ETEC in the sample.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Cloning of a galactose-binding lectin from the venom of Trimeresurus stejnegeri.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  A galactose-binding lectin isolated from the venom of Trimeresurus stejnegeri is a homodimer C-type lectin. The cloned cDNA encoding the monomer of Trimeresurus stejnegeri lectin (TSL) was sequenced and found to contain a 5'-end non-coding region, a sequence which encodes 135 amino acids, including a typical 23 amino acid signal peptide followed by the mature protein sequence, a 3'-end non-coding region, a polyadenylation signal, and a poly(A) region. To completely characterize the deduced amino acid sequence, on-line HPLC-MS and tandem MS were used to analyse the intact monomer and its proteolytic peptides. A modified peptide fragment was also putatively identified by HPLC-MS analysis. The deduced amino acid sequence was found to contain a carbohydrate-recognition domain homologous with those of some known C-type animal lectins. Thus TSL belongs to group VII of the C-type animal lectins  as classified by Drickamer ((1993) Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 45, 207-232). At present, a number of C-type lectins have been purified from snake venom, but most of them have been characterized only at the protein level. To our knowledge, this is the first known cDNA sequence of a true C-type lectin from snake venom.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Behavioural and biochemical changes after simultaneous and post-treatment of vitamin A and D on cadmium toxicity.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  In the present study, an investigation was undertaken to assess the protective efficacy in cadmium toxicity of vitamins administered simultaneously as well as post-treatment. Rats were treated with cadmium 1 mg/kg body weight (bw) powdered vitamin A chewable tablet 500 IU/kg bw/day and injectable vitamin D3 (made into a suspension with gum tragacanth in 100 ml distilled water) 100 IU/kg bw/day, mixed with powdered pellet feed and fed to experimental animals. Spontaneous motor activity and Rota Rod Endurance time was recorded after both simultaneous (for 21 days) and post-treatment (42 days). Vitamin treated animals by themselves behaved like controls but attenuated the cadmium effect when given Cd simultaneously or as post-treatment. While the biochemical changes were assayed, vitamins which did not have any influence on their own, given simultaneously and as post-treatment, antagonized  the cadmium effect on heart, liver tissues and serum. Both simultaneous and post-cadmium and -vitamin treatments significantly increased the activities of the enzymes aspartic amino transferase, alanine amino transferase, acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase in tissues and serum. Simultaneous and post-vitamin treatment with Cd had an effect of bringing back the activity of the enzymes closer to control values. These data suggest that treatment with vitamin A and D can minimise the Cd effect when given to the population exposed to Cd.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Decreased retinoblastoma protein expression in gamma-irradiated mouse ovarian follicles.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  We immunohistochemically examined the effect of gamma-radiation on immature mouse ovarian follicles. Mice were Jirradiated with a dose of LD80 (8.3Gy) in KAERI. At 0h, 6h, 12h, 1d, 2d, 4d and 8d postirradiation, the ovaries were excised and fixed in neutral buffered formalin. We performed immunohistochemistry for protein retinoblastoma (pRb), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) and routine hematoxylin-eosin staining in the largest cross sections. Radiation-induced follicular degeneration increased before 6h, and most irradiated ovarian follicles became acutely atretic. The immunohistochemical staining for pRb was strong in the nuclei of granulosa cells of normal follicles and weak in atretic ones which were, conversely, strong for TUNEL staining. It was shown that pRb expression became lower with the degeneration of the ovarian follicles,  which was inhibited by gamma-radiation. In the present study, pRb immunohistochemistry was proven to be a useful tool for the identification of follicular status.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Rapid on-farm analysis of manure nutrients using quick tests.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Quick tests enabling rapid, on-farm assessment of manure nutrient content could appreciably enhance manure management. The objectives of this study were to review the literature on the accuracy of quick tests, describe their operation, and to assess their ease of use and their suitability for routine on-farm use. These quick tests are the hydrometer, electrical conductivity (EC), ammonia electrode, reflectometer, Agros N Meter (or Nova meter), and Quantofix-N-Volumeter. The ammonia electrode provided accurate direct measurement of slurry ammonium; however, its fragility and the difficulty of setting it up, suggested limited suitability for on-farm use. The hydrometer indirectly measures total N and total P based on relationships with dry matter (total solids) content and specific gravity. Results have been variable between regions and species. Electrical conductivity is used as an indire ct measurement of ammonium and K; the limited results to date have been consistently good for ammonium N, and variable for K. The Agros N Meter and Quantofix-N-Volumeter both directly measure ammonium N and possibly some organic N. For both, agreement with lab analyses of ammonium N has been generally very good. The reflectometer measures the color intensity of test strips; limited results with ammonium N in slurries are promising. Several quick tests have the potential for accurately measuring manure nutrients on the farm. They generally were more effective with slurries than solid manures. For each quick test, single farm or regional calibrations with lab analysis are recommended, and in some cases necessary.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Pisces: Power industry integrated systems, chemical emissions study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Power industry chemical emissions study (PISCES) is a broad based study conducted by EPRI in the USA with input from utilities in the USA and other parts of the world. It aims to define the source, distribution, composition and fate of toxics in power plant process and waste streams. Eskom is partaking in this project to develop knowledge of trace element emissions from the power stations which will provide Eskom with sufficient information to determine the concentration levels of toxic trace element emissions from the power stations. From this, the fate of these emissions and their impacts on the environment can be determined. This paper is a report on the first sampling project conducted in South Africa at one of Eskom's power stations. The total study will involve sampling at other power stations and a risk analysis of the fate of the toxic elements emitted. This total study will be c ompleted in 1999.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Risk assessment using stochastic modeling of pollutant transport in landfill clay liners.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Risk assessment of landfill systems using Monte Carlo simulation in the prediction of groundwater contamination underneath a landfill insulated by clay liner is presented. The advantage of applying stochastic modeling is that uncertainties associated with various design parameters can be taken into account in the prediction of pollutant transport through the clay liner. A model based on a pollutant transport model considering advection, dispersion and sorption is developed in this study. The design parameters with their corresponding distribution forms are fed into the simulation model. The probability of the contaminant concentration in the groundwater underneath the landfill exceeding a predetermined value is used for risk assessment.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Modelling heavy metal mobilisation in solid waste depositspredictive tool for environmental risk assessment.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The release of heavy metal species from deposits of solid waste materials originating from minerals processing operations poses a serious environmental risk should such species migrate beyond the boundaries of the deposit into the surrounding environment. Legislation increasingly places the liability for wastes with the operators of the process that generates them. The costs for long-term monitoring and clean-up following a potential critical leakage have to be factored in the overall project plan from the outset. Thus assessment of the potential for a particular waste material to generate a harmful leachate is directly relevant for estimating the environmental risk associated with the planned disposal operation. A rigorous mechanistic model is proposed, which allows prediction of the time-dependent generation of a leachate from a solid mineral waste deposit. Model parameters are obtaine d from a suitably designed laboratory waste assessment methodology on a relatively small sample of the prospective waste material. The parameters are not specific to the laboratory environment in which they were obtained but are valid also for full-scale heap modelling. In this way the model, combined with the assessment methodology, becomes a powerful tool for meaningful assessment of the risks associated with solid waste disposal strategies.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Removal of refractory organics and color in pigment wastewater with Fenton oxidation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  This study was designed to evaluate (1) the removal of the non-biodegradable organics and color by Fenton's oxidation (2) the feasibility of Fenton's oxidation as a pretreatment or tertiary treatment following the activated sludge process in the pigment wastewater. The study was divided into two parts. The first part consisted of investigations on raw Yellow wastewater and Red wastewater, the second part was carried out on the final effluent from the existing extended aeration treatment plant. The batch test was conducted to determine the optimum conditions for plant operation such as pH, H2O2 dosage, molar ratio of Fe2+2O2 and contact time. It was found that the removal efficiencies of COD were 54.2%, 52.6% and 58.9%, the removal efficiencies of the color were 91.2%, 18.1% and 45.7%, for Red, Yellow Wastewater and Final Effluent, respectively. In the Yellow wastewater, BOD5/COD ratio  was not changed much after Fenton's oxidation, but in the case of the Red wastewater, BOD5/COD ratio was increased from 0.04 to 0.36. Therefore Fenton's oxidation process is a very effective means for a pretreatment or tertiary treatment in the Pigment wastewater.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Risk communication of hazardous processes associated with drinking water qualitytion, part 1</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  This paper describes a new method of measuring drinking water quality perceptions. Expert knowledge was captured and developed into a model which characterises the potentially hazardous processes inherent in the supply of drinking water. The methodology is based on the psychological framework of "mental modelling" and compares differences in knowledge between water industry experts and lay people. Qualitative studies revealed striking differences between the two groups. These findings are being used to evaluate and improve communications between water companies and their customers about the risks associated with drinking water.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>The effects of contaminated sediments of the Blesbok Spruit near Witbank on water quality and the toxicity thereof to Daphnia pulex.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  With the increasing focus on environmental issues, the objective of this study is to evaluate the potential impact of contaminated sediments of the Blesbok Spruit near Witbankr aliato organisms is considered to be a major route of exposure for many species, and therefore focusing attention on sediment contamination and highlighting the fact that sediments are an important resource. Acute toxicity tests were performed on Daphnia pulex using both extracted sediment interstitial water and surface water. Chemical analyses were also performed on the sediment, interstitial water and surface water samples. The toxicity results suggest that metal toxicity adds significantly to the toxicity of the stream water which is enhanced by the effect of pH. The pH of the stream and interstitial water wa s consistently below 4.5.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Treatment of palm oil mill effluent (POME) with the Membrane Anaerobic System (MAS).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  One of the major difficulties in anaerobic wastewater treatment processes is the need to retain a sufficient quantity of active biomass in the anaerobic reactor. The use of membranes to achieve external solid/liquid phase separation will result in the retention of the biomass at the surface of the membranes. In this study, the Membrane Anaerobic System (MAS) was used to treat industrial wastewater from a palm oil mill. The MAS was subjected to increasing organic loading rates (OLR) and a total of six steady states were attained. The first steady state influent COD concentration was 39,910 mg/l increasing to the final or sixth steady state COD concentration of 68,310 mg/l. The efficiency of COD removal was between 91.7 to 94.2 percent with an average HRT of 3.03 days. The maximum OLR applied during the sixth steady state was 21.7 kgCOD/m3/d. The reactor mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS ) was between 50,000 to 57,000 mg/l while the percentage of the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) was between 74 to 82 percent. A crossflow ultraftration (UF) module was used to filter the final effluent and simultaneously retain biomass in the anaerobic reactor. A clear final effluent was produced but membrane flux rate deterioration was observed due to membrane fouling. Membrane fouling could be minimised with faster crossflow feed velocities and regular membrane flushing.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Case study on the bioeffluent of petrochemical wastewater by electro-Fenton method.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The electro-Fenton method, in which ferrous ion is produced at the anode and used as a catalyst of H2O2, was applied for treating the bioeffluent of petrochemical manufacturing wastewater. The major pollutant in the bioeffluent was identified as hexamine, which was nonbiodegradable and contributed 65% of COD. The goal of this study was to treat the biotreatment effluent with more than 50% of COD removal efficiency. Oxidants that involved ozone, ozone2O2, sodium hypochlorite, and Fenton's reagent were employed to treat this effluent by jar tests. However, none could meet the goal in the range of operating conditions used. On the other hand, more than 80% of COD was removed with the electro-Fenton process. These screening tests indicated that only the electro-Fenton process was compatible with the goal.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Long-term stability of KEtX-Cu(OH)2 matrix in landfill leachates.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  In this study, the long-term stability of KEtXu(OH)2 matrix under early-period and late-period landfill leachates was evaluated using semi-dynamic leaching test (SDLT), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) techniques. The results of SDLT after 60-day periods of extraction indicated that the cumulative leaching of Cu was only 0.72% and 3.34% of the total Cu in the KEtX/Cu(OH)2 matrix under early-period and late-period landfill leachates, respectively. The investigation of crystallinity and functional groups between the leached KEtX/Cu(OH)2 matrices after 1-day and 60-day periods of extraction using XRD and FTIR indicated that the KEtX/Cu(OH)2 matrices were perfectly unaffected by the extraction using early-period and late-period landfill leachates during the 60-day leach time. Consequently, the KEtX/Cu(OH)2 matrix had a stabilizing behavior extracted in landf ill leachates.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Zinc biosorption by waste activated and digested sludges.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Biological matter is known for its ability to biosorb solubilised heavy metal ions to its surface. Experiments were therefore conducted to assess the biosorptive capacity of two waste products of the wastewater treatment industry ie., waste activated and waste digested sludge. Surface charge of each was determined in order to relate electronegativity with biosorptive potential. Activated sludge was found to be more effective than digested sludge for removal of zinc from a metal plating effluent, viz., 5.9 mg Zn/(g sludge)-1 as opposed to 4.0 mg/g, respectively, as well as producing a higher net negative charge. It was also noted that as initial zinc concentrations in solution increased there was a concomitant increase in sludge biosorption capacity. Activated and digested sludges were capable of biosorbing zinc from a metal plating effluent although activated sludge showed better potenti al for industrial application.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Comparative study of wastewater purification efficiencies of two emergent helophytes: Typha latifolia and Juncus subulatus under arid climate.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The aim of the present study is to assess wastewater purification efficiency of two higher aquatic plant, Typha latifolia and Juncus subulatus in an and climate. The experiment was conducted from August 1994 to March 1996. The plots (capacity: 115 liters, diameter: 57 cm) were filled to 5 cm depth with gravel and 30 cm with soil (texture: 30% clay, 34% silt and 36% sand) and planted with young shoots of Typha and Juncus. The plots without plant were used as controls. The plots were weekly and exclusively irrigated by urban raw wastewater (25 liters). The influent was percolating through the substratum. Results revealed significant performances for reduction of organic load in all systems. Indeed, COD and TSS removal efficiencies were respectively 91% and 73% for Typha latifolia, 92% and 76% for Juncus subulatus, 83% and 73% for an unplanted system. Depletion of nutrients during the exper imental period was low and even negative: 32% TP (total phosphorus) and 31% NH4 (ammoniacal nitrogen) in Typha system, 27% TP and 17% NH4 in Juncus system, -10% TP and -22% NH4 in unplanted system. In addition, the presence of these helophytes maintained sufficient porosity in order to allow water percolation treatment. The unplanted system clogged in winter.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Performance of horizontal-flow anaerobic immobilized sludge (HAIS) reactor treating synthetic substrate subjected to decreasing COD to sulfate ratios.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The performance of a bench-scale horizontal-flow anaerobic immobilized sludge (HAIS) reactor treating a synthetic substrate under increasing influent sulfate (SO42-) concentrations was investigated. The synthetic substrate was composed of glucose, methanol and ammonium acetate, besides bicarbonate and trace metal nutritional solution. The reactor was filled with polyurethane foam cubic matrices for biomass immobilization. Influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) was kept almost constant along the experiments (2162 | 250 mg.l-1) while influent sulfate concentration was increased from 9 to 501 mg.l-1, resulting in COD42- ratio of 249, 66, 19.7 and 4.3 in the four experimental phases tested. After a short start-up period, no significant variations in COD removal efficiency were observed for the COD to sulfate ratios evaluated. Although sulfate reduction was expected to interfere with the me thanogenic process, detrimental effects on the overall reactor performance were not observed. Moreover, monitoring parameters indicated that the reactor achieved stable operational conditions immediately after short transient periods following the increase of influent sulfate concentrations. Microscopic analysis of the sludge within the reactor permitted to observe the presence of both methanogenic and sulfate reducing bacteria, indicating that syntrophism and not competition seemed to be the predominant relationship between these two groups under the COD to sulfate ratios assayed./POISONING</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>TIE and TRE: An abbreviated guide to dealing with toxicity.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The UK environmental regulator, the Environment Agency, is at present in the process of introducing a revision to the effluent discharge consenting system, based on the assessment of whole effluent toxicityect Toxicity Assessment (DTA). The concepts of the most 'sensitive' species and of risk assessment based on estimation of Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) form the basis of the proposed consenting structure. The objective is to control the toxicity of point source discharges to riverine, estuarine and coastal waters and it raises the need for understanding of the nature and expression of toxicity in such discharges. Internationally recognised toxicity test protocols are well established, enabling the quantitative measurement of toxicity with levels of confidence similar to the more traditional physical and chemical determinands, such as individual organic sol vents, COD or metals. However, traditional protocols are seen as resource intensive and as involving high cost. This paper presents some experiences from the Zeneca Brixham Environmental Laboratory in the characterisation of the toxicity expressed to freshwater and marine species by several chemical manufacturing effluents and in the conduct of a number of Toxicity Identification Evaluations (TIE) using both standard and enhanced protocols for toxicity testing.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Ranking of Toxics Release Inventory chemicals using a Level III fugacity model and toxicity.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  In an effort to lessen the environmental impact of chemicals discharged by industry, some countries rank chemicals according to mass released each year and then set environmental protection policy based upon this ranking. These rankings have driven industries and companies to change their process configurations and their chemical releases to reduce the release of higher ranking chemicals. But, chemicals that are higher ranked due to mass release may not be particularly toxic nor persistent in the environment; conversely, lower ranked chemicals may be substantially more toxic and persistent in the environment. The physical/chemical properties of forty five organic chemicals from the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory were used as inputs to a Level III fugacity model to estimate fate, transport, and steady state concentrations of chemicals in the environment. The resulting concentrations in the  air and water, for each chemical, were determined using the fugacity model and were then compared with toxicity data, the ratio was used as an indication of the environmental impact of the release of each chemical. The chemicals were then ranked according to the degree of environmental impact and the results were compared to other ranking systems reported in the literature.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>A simple UV spectrophotometric procedure for the survey of industrial sewage system.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  A simple UV spectrophotometric procedure is proposed for the survey of an industrial sewage system. Simple, fast and reliable, this technique has been first designed for natural and waste water. It is based on the assumption that any UV spectrum of a sample can be decomposed by using a set of reference spectra. The main application is the determination of specific compounds such as nitrate or anionic surfactants (expressed as DBS) or the estimation of global parameters such as COD, TOC or TSS. Another interest can be found in process control or alarm detection. Based on the UV light absorption by all unsaturated compounds and particularly anthropogenic organic matter, the method is obviously limited by the nature of organics. So, its use for industrial application needs a good knowledge of wastewater composition -and variation- for the choice of the dedicated spectra library. This paper  will present the industrial application of UV spectrophotometry including the methods for the definition of the spectra libraries. Its application in the wastewater survey of a large petrochemical site, located in the South of France, is also presented.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Prediction of microbial toxicity of industrial organic chemicals.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Aqueous solubility is evaluated as a predictor of microbial toxicity. Experimental toxicity data for activated sludge, methanogens, nitrobacter, and two commercial cultures, Polytox and Microtox were correlated with experimental solubility data for over 70 organic chemicals of diverse molecular structures and congeneric families. The database covered over 8 log units of aqueous solubility and over 6 log units of IC50 values. Statistically significant correlations were found between log (IC50) and log (solubility) for all the microorganisms, with coefficients of correlation ranging from 0.70 to 0.76 at a level of significance of p = 0.0001. An overall correlation was found to be log (IC50, mM/l) = 0.68 log (Solubility, mM/l) - 0.25, with an r2 = 0.756 for nearly 200 data points.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Assessment of complex industrial effluents in the Netherlands using a Whole Effluent Toxicity (or wet) approach.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The assessment of Dutch waste water discharges or effluents is focused on the reduction of specific pollutants or substances. Many effluents in the Netherlands are of a complex nature though. Because of several limitations, an assessment of complex effluents is not possible by merely using a chemical specific approach. Examples are lack of analytical techniques, lack of ecotoxicological data and unknown combination processes. Therefore an additional approach is needed. The Whole Effluent Toxicity or WET approach has been introduced to overcome the mentioned limitations. It focuses on acute toxicity. In 1994 a pilot study was initiated in order to try out, adjust and evaluate the WET approach. The aims were to gain more insight in the occurrence of acute toxicity in complex effluents, and to try and prove the additional value of the approach. The study was performed with 17 different indu strial effluents, consisting of 6 industrial branches. All effluents were tested with four differentorganisms. The results showed acute toxicity for at least one organism in 15 out of 17 effluents. In 8 cases the toxicity of the effluents could not be explained by using physical and chemical data. The results clearly show that the use of acute toxicity tests produces valuable, and especially additional, information.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>UV treatability test for chemical and petrochemical wastewater.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  There is a tendency to design biological units for chemical or petrochemical wastewater treatment. Some of these treatment plants are even sometimes used for the degradation of any external industrial sewage transported for the purpose. In this case, the decision to accept or refuse the waste must be rapid and sure. The aim of this paper is to propose a new treatability test based on a direct far UV photooxidation of the sample, coupled with a UV spectrophotometric survey of the waste quality. The test has been applied on different samples from chemical and petrochemical industries and the results have been compared to those obtained with more classical tests, as for example, biodegradation tests using either air or pure oxygen. For most of the samples, quite good correlation has been observed between the photooxidation test and biodegradation. The UV treatability test is currently used  for checking up on petrochemical wastewater and chemical sewage.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Concepts and methodologies to minimize pollutant discharge for zero-emission production.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The present study aims to present basic concepts to minimize the emissions from industrial production processes. Strategies and methodologies to analyze emissions from various production processes, to establish a so called negative flow sheet and to reduce the emissions from those processes by refining and/or replacing the present production process with an alternative process are discussed. Preliminary evaluation and management systems of the materials used in the production process based on characteristics such as microbial and physico-chemical treatabilities are proposed as well. The relationship between the removal efficiency of dissolved organic carbon in the five-days BOD test and that in a laboratory scale submerged biofilter with continuous operation is suggested to evaluate the biological removability of organic pollutants contained in wastewater. A novel concept to select the a ppropriate treatment process of an industrial wastewater based on properties such as the molecular size and biodegradability of the pollutants contained in that wastewater is also proposed. To give basic information for the minimization of energy consumption in wastewater treatment, various biological wastewater treatment processes are compared from the view point of power economy.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>The sequence of the non-haemolytic enterotoxin operon from Bacillus cereus.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The non-haemolytic enterotoxin from Bacillus cereus has been sequenced. It is composed of three components, non-haemolytic enterotoxin A, B and C of 41.0, 39.8 and 36.5 kDa, respectively. Transcription of the operon seems to be positively regulated by plcR, a gene that also regulates phospholipase C expression. There is substantial similarity between the three proteins of non-haemolytic enterotoxin and between the non-haemolytic enterotoxin and haemolytic enterotoxin proteins.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Mobile catabolic genes in bacteria.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The recent findings of various mobile catabolic genes have provided some insight into the evolution of microbial degradation systems for xenobiotic compounds. The catabolic genes undergo marked genetic rearrangements due to their presence on transposons or association with mobile genetic elements. Bacterial catabolic transposons fall into three defined structural classes. Class I elements include catabolic genes flanked by two copies of insertion sequences. Class II elements carry short terminal inverted repeats and transpose by the replicative mode in which transposase and resolvase are involved. Conjugative catabolic transposons represent the third class of mobile genetic elements. They carry all the genes required for excision, conjugal transfer to a new host, and integration. This review focuses on the structures, functions and roles of the recently characterized catabolic transposon s in bacteria. Also described are the mobile catabolic elements that share structural similarity with the pathogenicity and symbiosis islands.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Gene sequence and properties of an s-triazine ring-cleavage enzyme from Pseudomonas sp. strain NRRLB-12227.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Pesticides based on the s-triazine ring structure are widely used in cultivation of food crops. Cleavage of the s-triazine ring is an important step in the mineralization of s-triazine compounds and hence in their complete removal from the environment. Cyanuric acid amidohydrolase cleaves cyanuric acid (2,4,6-trihydroxy-s-triazine), which yields carbon dioxide and biuret; the biuret is subject to further metabolism, which yields CO2 and ammonia. The trzD gene encoding cyanuric acid amidohydrolase was cloned into pMMB277 from Pseudomonas sp. strain NRRLB-12227, a strain that is capable of utilizing s-triazines as nitrogen sources. Hydrolysis of cyanuric acid was detected in crude extracts of Escherichia coli containing the cloned gene by monitoring the disappearance of cyanuric acid and the appearance of biuret by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). DEAE and hydrophobic interac tion HPLC were used to purify cyanuric acid amidohydrolase to homogeneity, and a spectrophotometric assay for the purified enzyme was developed. The purified enzyme had an apparent Km of 0.05 mM for cyanuric acid at pH 8.0. The enzyme did not cleave any other s-triazine or hydroxypyrimidine compound, although barbituric acid (2,4,6-trihydroxypyrimidine) was found to be a strong competitive inhibitor. Neither the nucleotide sequence of trzD nor the amino acid sequence of the gene product exhibited a significant level of similarity to any known gene or protein.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Activation process of dipteran-specific insecticidal protein produced by Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Dipteran-specific insecticidal protein Cry4A is produced as a protoxin of 130 kDa in Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis. Here we performed the in vitro processing of Cry4A and showed that the 130-kDa protoxin of Cry4A was processed into the two protease-resistant fragments of 20 and 45 kDa through the intramolecular cleavage of a 60-kDa intermediate. The processing into these two fragments was also observed in vivo. To investigate functional properties of the two fragments, GST (glutathione S-transferase) fusion proteins of the 60-kDa intermediate and the 20- and 45-kDa fragments were constructed. Neither the GST-20-kDa fusion protein (GST-20) nor the GST-45-kDa fusion protein (GST-45) was actively toxic against mosquito larvae of Culex pipiens, whereas the GST-60-kDa intermediate fusion protein (GST-60) exhibited significant toxicity. However, when the two fusion proteins GST-20  and GST-45 coexisted, significant toxicity was observed. The coprecipitation experiment demonstrated that the two fragments associated with each other. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that the two fragments formed an active complex of apparently 60 kDa. A mutant of the 60-kDa protein which was apparently resistant to the intramolecular cleavage with the midgut extract of C. pipiens larvae had toxicity slightly lower than that of GST-60.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Structure variations in membranes of proliferating leucocytes L-41 as affected by low doses of ionizing radiation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The dose-dependent effects of gamma-radiation on the leucocyte cultures L-41 has been investigated. Irradiation by the dose of 0.25 Gy stimulates the cell proliferation while that by the doses of 1.0 and 2.0 Gy inhibits this process. In this dose range the radiohormesis effects characterizing structural organization of the probed membranes have been also registered for fluorescence parameters. The zone of qualitative transition of response of the cell membranes to radiation is individual for various effects. The action of radiation in the doses of 0.25 and 0.50 Gy induces a decrease of ANS fluorescence intensity and a decrease of membrane protein immersion in the lipid bilayer of leukocyte membranes. The values of these parameters rise at the doses of 1.0 and 2.0 Gy that reflects different directions of structural changes in various membrane regions. The irradiation in the range of 0.25-1.0  Gy induces the increase of microviscosity in deep regions of membrane lipid matrix while at the dose 2.0 Gy it causes its decrease. Radioactive radiation does not change the membrane protein conformation of leukocytes and polarity of lipid bilayer hydrophobic zones as recorded by fluorescent methods used.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Effect of Arnica montana on the state of lipids peroxidation and protective glutathione system of rat liver in case of experimental toxic hepatitis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Effects of Tinctura Arnica on lipids peroxidation and on the protective glutathions system of liver in rats in case of experimental toxic hepatitis have been studied. Toxic hepatitis is accompanied by deep alterations of the oxidant-antioxidant status of the body. Intoxication of the body by CCl4 results in intensification of the free radicals formation particularly in liver: accumulation of lipids peroxidation molecular products, glutathione system enzyme activity inhibition in early terms and its partial restoration in remote terms has been seen. Our studies revealed that Arnica montana infusion inhibits the rate of lipids perioxidation products formation, affects the glutathione system enzymes activity.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Electromagnetic radiation influence on nonlinear charge and energy transport in biosystems.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The influence of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) on charge and energy transport processes in biological systems is studied in the light of the soliton model. It is shown that in the spectrum of biological effects of EMR there are two frequency resonances corresponding to qualitatively different frequency dependent effects of EMR on solitons. One of them is connected with the quasiresonance dynamic response of solitons to the EMR. At EMR frequencies close to the dynamic resonance frequency the solitons absorb energy from the field and generate intensive vibrational modes in the macromolecule. The second EMR resonance is connected with soliton decay due to the quantum mechanical transition of the system from the bound soliton state into the excited unbound states.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Direct tritium labeling of multifunctional compounds using organoiridium catalysis. 2.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  A variety of complex compounds have been labeled with tritium gas by catalytic exchange in the presence of catalyst precursors ((cod)Ir(dppe))BF4 or ((cod)Ir(py)(PCy3))BF4. In most cases, predictable regioselectivity and high specific activities are achieved. These results are compared in some cases to the results of labeling related compounds with ((cod)Ir(PPh3)2)BF4. Prereduction of the catalyst precursors in situ with hydrogen allows the use of smaller quantities of tritium gas and reduces the amount of radioactive waste. Two or more compounds can be labeled simultaneously as mixtures then separated in the HPLC purification step to increase compound throughput.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Tephrosia purpurea ameliorates benzoyl peroxide-induced cutaneous toxicity in mice: Diminution of oxidative stress.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The modulatory effect of Tephrosia purpurea on benzoyl peroxide-induced cutaneous oxidative stress is described. Benzoyl peroxide is an effective cutaneous tumour promoter acting through the generation of oxidative stress. Benzoyl peroxide treatment increases cutaneous microsomal lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide generation. The activity of cutaneous antioxidant enzymes, catalase glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase is decreased and the levels of cutaneous glutathione are depleted. Prophylactic treatment of mice with T. purpurea 12 h before benzoyl peroxide treatment resulted in the diminution of benzoyl peroxide-mediated damage. The susceptibility of cutaneous microsomal membrane to lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide generation was significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). In addition depleted levels of glutathione  and inhibited activity of antioxidant enzymes were recovered to a significant level (P &lt;0.05). The protective effect of T. purpurea was dose-dependent. The results suggest that T. purpurea is an effective chemopreventive agent in skin that may suppress benzoyl peroxide-induced cutaneous toxicity.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Normal human immunoglobulin G4 is bispecific: It has two different antigen-combining sites.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Unlike other immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses, IgG4 antibodies in plasma have been reported to be functionally monovalent. In this paper we show that the apparent monovalency of circulating IgG4 is caused by asymmetry of plasma IgG4. A large fraction of plasma IgG4 molecules have two different antigen-binding sites, resulting in bispecificity. Sera from patients with IgG4 antibodies to both house dust mite and grass pollen induced cross-linking of Sepharose-bound grass pollen antigen to radiolabelled house dust mite allergen Der p I. This bispecific binding activity was not observed in sera with IgG4 antibodies to either grass pollen or house dust mite exclusively. Depletion of IgG4 antibodies resulted in disappearance of the bispecific activity. By size exclusion chromatography we excluded the possibility that bispecific activity was caused by aggregation of IgG4 antibodies. These resu lts indicate that circulating (polyclonal) IgG4 antibodies have two different antigen-binding sitesand therefore are functionally monovalent antibodies.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Inhibition of Bcl-xL expression sensitizes normal human keratinocytes and epithelial cells to apoptotic stimuli.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The epidermis is continually exposed to harmful mutagens that have the potential to cause DNA damage. To protect the skin from accumulating mutated cells, keratinocytes have developed a highly regulated mechanism of eliminating damaged cells through apoptosis. Bcl-xL is a well-described cell survival protein that when overexpressed in skin can protect keratinocytes from UV radiation-induced apoptosis. To begin to unravel the complex mechanisms that keratinocytes use to survive, we wanted to characterize the role of endogenous Bcl-xL in protecting cells from death. In this study, we describe the development and characterization of an antisense inhibitor to Bcl-xL. We show that this inhibitor reduces Bcl-xL RNA and protein in a concentration-dependent, sequence-specific manner. Furthermore, treatment of keratinocytes and epithelial cells with this inhibitor sensitizes these cells to UV-B r adiation and cisplatinum treatment-induced apoptosis. Thus, these results offer direct evidencethat Bcl-xL is critical in the protection of skin and epithelial cells from apoptosis and provide a basis for the role of Bcl-xL in keratinocyte and epithelial cell survival.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Importance of the beta12-beta13 loop in protein phosphatase-1 catalytic subunit for inhibition by toxins and mammalian protein inhibitors.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Type-1 protein serine/threonine phosphatases (PP1) are uniquely inhibited by the mammalian proteins, inhibitor-1 (I-1), inhibitor-2 (I-2), and nuclear inhibitor of PP1 (NIPP-1). In addition, several natural compounds inhibit both PP1 and the type-2 phosphatase, PP2A. Deletion of C-terminal sequences that included the beta12-beta13 loop attenuated the inhibition of the resulting PP1alpha catalytic core by I-1, I-2, NIPP-1, and several toxins, including tautomycin, microcystin-LR, calyculin A, and okadaic acid. Substitution of C-terminal sequences from the PP2A catalytic subunit produced a chimeric enzyme, CRHM2, that was inhibited by toxins with dose-response characteristics of PP1 and not PP2A. However, CRHM2 was insensitive to the PP1-specific inhibitors, I-1, I-2, and NIPP-1. The anticancer compound, fostriecin, differed from other phosphatase inhibitors in that it inhibited wild-type PP1alpha, the  PP1alpha catalytic core, and CRHM2 with identical IC50. Binding of wild-type and mutant phosphatases to immobilized microcystin-LR, NIPP-1, and I-2 established that the beta12-beta13 loop was essential for the association of PP1 with toxins and the protein inhibitors. These studies point to the importance of the beta12-beta13 loop structure and conformation for the control of PP1 functions by toxins and endogenous proteins.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Heme oxygenase induction mediates the photoimmunoprotective activity of UVA radiation in the mouse.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  In contrast to the immunosuppressive potential of UVB (280-320 nm) radiation in experimental animals and humans, UVA (320-400 nm) radiation at environmentally relevant doses appears to be immunologically inert. However, such exposure to UVA radiation has been observed unexpectedly to induce resistance to UVB-induced immunosuppression in mice, by a mechanism resulting in the inactivation of cis-urocanic acid (UCA), an epidermal immunosuppressive UV photoproduct. In this study in mice, we show that the immunoprotective activity of UVA radiation, against the effects of both UVB radiation and cis-UCA, can be attributed to the induction of cutaneous heme oxygenase (HO; EC 1.14.99.3). Cell-mediated immune function was assessed in vivo by the contact hypersensitivity response induced to oxazolone at an unirradiated skin site, and HO enzyme activity was measured in cutaneous microsomal preparati ons from treated mice. There was a progressive increase in HO enzyme activity for at least 3 days after UVA irradiation. However HO activity, both constitutive and UVA radiation-induced, was sensitive to the effects of injecting mice with the specific HO inhibitor, tin protoporphyrin (Sn (IV) protoporphyrin IX; SnPP). We observed, in addition, that in SnPP-injected mice, the immunoprotective effect of UVA radiation against either UVB radiation or cis-UCA was abrogated. Because SnPP injection did not affect normal contact hypersensitivity responsiveness but did inhibit the constitutive HO enzyme activity, it appeared that only the inducible HO was active in modulating immune function. This finding indicates that UVA-induced HO activity is a major player in the skin defenses against UVB immunosuppression.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>A phenotype for enigmatic DNA polymerase II: A pivotal role for pol II in replication restart in UV-irradiated Escherichia coli.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  DNA synthesis in Escherichia coli is inhibited transiently after UV irradiation. Induced replisome reactivation or "replication restart" occurs shortly thereafter, allowing cells to complete replication of damaged genomes. At the present time, the molecular mechanism underlying replication restart is not understood. DNA polymerase II (pol II), encoded by the dinA (polB) gene, is induced as part of the global SOS response to DNA damage. Here we show that pol II plays a pivotal role in resuming DNA replication in cells exposed to UV irradiation. There is a 50-min delay in replication restart in mutant cells lacking pol II. Although replication restart appears normal in DELTAumuDC strains containing pol II, the restart process is delayed for &gt;90 min in cells lacking both pol II and UmuD'2C. Because of the presence of pol II, a transient replication-restart burst is observed in a "quick-stop" te mperature-sensitive pol III mutant (dnaE486) at nonpermissive temperature. However, complete recovery of DNA synthesis requires the concerted action of both pol II and pol III. Our data demonstrate that pol II and UmuD'2C act in independent pathways of replication restart, thereby providing a phenotype for pol II in the repair of UV-damaged DNA.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>The effects of ellagic acid on arylamine N-acetyltransferase activity in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in Pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited by ellagic acid (EA), a naturally occurring dietary plant phenol. By measuring the acetylation of 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), the NAT activity was determined. In P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, a NAT activity of 1.37 | 0.25 nmol/min/1010 CFU for intact cell and a NAT activity of 5.92 | 0.20 nmol/min/mg protein for cytosolic preparation were measured. EA (ranging from 1 to 0.125 mM) showed a dose-dependent inhibition of NAT activities in the analysis of both intact cell and cytosolic preparations. Enzymatic kinetics were determined and found that EA was a potent non-competitive inhibitor of NAT activity in P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. EA inhibition of NAT activities in P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 was time-dependent for at least 4 hrs. These data strongly indicated that EA could suppress NAT activity in P. aeruginosa.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>An estimate of the Plumed Frogmouth Podargus ocellatus plumiferus population size in the Conondale Ranges.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Marbled Frogmouths are rare, cryptic, shy, nocturnal birds restricted primarily to rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest. Two sub-species are recognized in two isolated areas on the east Australian coast. A stronghold for the southern subspecies (Plumed Frogmouth) occurs in the Conondale Ranges. This area has been subject to forestry practices for the past 100 years. Because of public concerns and a perceived need to undertake planning and management to assist in conserving the species, a study was undertaken to assess its population status. Radio-tracked adults associated primarily with rainforest and wet sclerophyll along drainage lines, although gullies containing rainforest species within dry sclerophyll were also utilized. Taped playback of Plumed Frogmouth calls revealed a distribution within core habitat (rainforest and wet sclerophyll) across the Conondale Ranges. Individuals rad io-tracked in the Conondale Ranges occupied home ranges from 5 to 18 ha. Estimates of the combined home ranges of pairs ranged from 12 to 19 ha. Home range overlap between pairs was minimal. An assessment of the area of currently suitable core habitat (14 508 ha) within the Conondale Range forested area suggests that conservatively, 755 pairs currently exist; if potential future habitat (i.e., regenerating) of 1 954 ha is taken into consideration, this figure will rise to 857 pairs. If use of dry sclerophyll by birds is also taken into account then these estimates may be as high as 858 and 974 pairs respectively. There is currently no reliable estimate of the amount of suitable habitat, which is not occupied by Plumed Frogmouths or of habitat only occupied by single unpaired birds or non-breeding pairs. Future research should aim to redress this lack of information which could severely r educe any estimates of the numbers of breeding pairs.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution, species stock and habitat of the Blue-winged Sand Grasshopper, Sphingonotus caerulans (L.), in the Eastern Harz Foothills and the Eastern Harz Glacis, with comments on the taxonomic status (Saltatoria: Acrididae: Oedipodinae).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Basing on a literature survey and an intensive mapping information on distribution, species stock and habitat of an endangered grasshopper species, Sphingonotus caerulans (L.), in the region Eastern Harz Foothills and the adjacent Eastern Harz Glacis (Sachsen-Anhalt) were collected. In the study area the species populates exclusively secondary habitates created by human activities. Regional distribution centres are the abandoned coal-mined landscape in the Merseburg region, the city of Halle and the Mansfeld copper shale mining district. Thus, the most populations could be found in dump site biotopes as well as on industrial fallow land. Furthermore, clay and potash stockpiles, sand pits and similar biotopes play an important role for the distribution of S. caerulans. Information on sympatric Saltatoria species are given. - S. caerulans is threated mainly by ongoing succession, but as we ll by gravel mining and building activities. The bigger part of the populations in the study area seems to be badly endangered. - All of the examined populations (and likely all populations in Sachsen-Anhalt) belong to the subspecies S. c. cyanopterus (CHARP.).</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Perkinsus marinus extracellular protease modulates survival of Vibrio vulnificus in eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) hemocytes.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The in vitro effects of the Perkinsus marinus serine protease on the intracellular survival of Vibrio vulnificus in oyster hemocytes were examined by using a time-course gentamicin internalization assay. Results showed that protease-treated hemocytes were initially slower to internalize V. vulnificus than untreated hemocytes. After 1 h, the elimination of V. vulnificus by treated hemocytes was significantly suppressed compared with hemocytes infected with invasive and noninvasive controls. Our data suggest that the serine protease produced by P. marinus suppresses the vibriocidal activity of oyster hemocytes to effectively eliminate V. vulnificus, potentially leading to conditions favoring higher numbers of vibrios in oyster tissues.</AbstractText>

<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  This study compared the activity of commercial liquid sterilants and disinfectants on Bacillus subtilis spores deposited on three types of devices made of noncorrodible, corrodible, or polymeric material. Products like Renalin, Exspor, Wavicide-01, Cidexplus, and cupric ascorbate were tested under conditions specified for liquid sterilization. These products, at the shorter times indicated for disinfection, and popular disinfectants, like Clorox, Cavicide, and Lysol were also studied. Data obtained with a sensitive and quantitative test suggest that commercial liquid sterilants and disinfectants are less effective on contaminated surfaces than generally acknowledged.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Transduction of enteric Escherichia coli isolates with a derivative of Shiga toxin 2-encoding bacteriophage phi3538 isolated from Escherichia coli O157:H7.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  We investigated the ability of a detoxified derivative of a Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2)-encoding bacteriophage to infect and lysogenize enteric Escherichia coli strains and to develop infectious progeny from such lysogenized strains. The stx2 gene of the patient E. coli O157:H7 isolate 3538/95 was replaced by the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene from plasmid pACYC184. Phage phi3538(DELTAstx2::cat) was isolated after induction of E. coli O157:H7 strain 3538/95 with mitomycin. A variety of strains of enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), Stx-producing E. coli (STEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), and E. coli from the physiological stool microflora were infected with phi3538(DELTAstx2::cat), and plaque formation and lysogenic conversion of wild-type E. coli strains were investigated. With the exception of one EIEC strain, none of the E.  coli strains supported the formation of plaques when used as indicators for phi3538(DELTAstx2::cat). However, 2 of 11 EPEC, 11 of 25 STEC, 2 of 7 EAEC, 1 of 3 EIEC, and 1 of 6 E. coli isolates from the stool microflora of healthy individuals integrated the phage in their chromosomes and expressed resistance to chloramphenicol. Following induction with mitomycin, these lysogenic strains released infectious particles of phi3538(DELTAstx2::cat) that formed plaques on a lawn of E. coli laboratory strain C600. The results of our study demonstrate that phi3538(DELTAstx2::cat) was able to infect and lysogenize particular enteric strains of pathogenic and nonpathogenic E. coli and that the lysogens produced infectious phage progeny. Stx-encoding bacteriophages are able to spread stx genes among enteric E. coli strains.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Technological optimisation of Picante cheese using microbiological, chemical and physical criteria.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  In order to optimise the final quality of Picante cheese, several processing parameters (i.e., volumetric fraction of caprine milk, ripening time and percentage of salt added to fresh cheese) were manipulated and gave rise to a number of experimental cheeses produced according to a second-order, composite factorial design. Microbiological, physicochemical, biochemical and textural analyses were carried out in samples from all experimental cheeses. The most important effect in microbiological terms was produced by ripening time, in both linear and quadratic forms; caprine milk fraction and amount of salt added were also found to be significant factors, again in both linear and quadratic forms, especially with respect to total viable mesophilic microorganisms, Enterobacteriaceae and staphylococci. In terms of proteolysis and lipolysis, ripening time was the dominant factor, but caprine mil k fraction and NaCl content were also significant at the 5% level. A higher content of caprine milk was associated with higher extents of proteolysis and lipolysis, but the reverse held for NaCl content. It was concluded that 50-80% (v/v) caprine milk, ripening for 195 days and 15% (w/wTS) NaCl provide safe counts of Enterobacteriaceae and staphylococci, while maximising proteolysis and lipolysis in Picante cheese.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Detection of illicit opioid and cocaine use in methadone maintenance treatment.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Urine toxicology is the gold standard for estimating the prevalence of illicit drug use in methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). The frequency of urine testing may be crucial for establishing accurate use rates. Infrequent testing may lead programs to undercount active drug users and to target interventions too narrowly. This study compared results from frequent testing (twice per week) versus less frequent testing of 166 patients at four MMT programs. As part of a research study, all patients were tested by research staff for opioid and cocaine use twice per week on a fixed schedule for 10 weeks. During the same period, the four MMT programs tested the patients according to their standard protocols, approximately weekly (one program) or every 3-4 weeks (three programs). The research tests identified approximately 50% more illicit opioid users and 70% more cocaine users than the less fr equent program tests. Patients who were drug positive according to the research tests but drug negative according to the program tests tended to be infrequent users. The data suggest that standard urine testing practices in MMT programs may result in underestimates of the prevalence of opioid and cocaine use. More frequent testing, even for time-limited periods, should produce more accurate depictions of drug use prevalence and help indicate the direction of interventions.</AbstractText>

A sequence of 91 amino acids residues, probably starting from the N-terminal of the mature protein, was determined for the 105-kDa protein of the non-haemolytic enterotoxin of Bacillus cereus. The last part of this sequence was similar to parts of the N-terminal portions of two collagenases of Clostridium histolyticum and Clostridium perfringens. Zymography, with intact collagen fibril and gelatin as substrates, showed that the 105-kDa protein had collagenolytic and gelatinolytic activity. The 105-kDa protein also showed activity against a typical collagenase substrate, azocoll, and was inhibited by EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline. We conclude that the 105-kDa protein is a collagenase.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Livestock nutrient management concerns: Regulatory and legislative overview.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  A greater focus on manure nutrient disposition from concentrated animal-feeding operations has developed from environmentalists, concerned citizens, and regulatory agencies. The establishment and enforcement of manure nutrient regulations will alter the future of livestock production. Proposed legislation and strategies may provide a false sense of security regarding environmental preservation or restoration and may impose monitoring and record keeping on the livestock operators. Existing regulations and proposed regulations and strategies are presented. Implications of legislation and proposed strategies, policies, and regulations are discussed. Livestock operations will need to comply with regulations to remain in business and to minimize environmental liability.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Direct amplification of Escherichia coli O157 vero toxin genes from human faeces by the polymerase chain reaction.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Direct amplification of DNA from clinical specimens, such as blood and faeces, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is most often hindered by endogenous inhibitory substances, including haemoglobin and bile acids. We tested whether Ampdirect  A (Shimadzu), a novel reagent cocktail that has been shown to suppress the inhibitors in blood, is also useful for faecal samples, and found that the vero toxin genes (VT1 and VT2) of Escherichia coli O157 could be efficiently amplified from the supernatant of boiled faeces by PCR in the presence of thic cocktail without prior extraction of DNA. We compared the efficiency of amplification with and without the cocktail, using the supernatant of boiled normal faeces supplemented with E. coli O157. PCR without the cocktail failed to amplify the vero toxin genes from the supernatant diluted &lt;6400-fold or containing &gt;0.02% (final concentration) of boiled f aeces. By contrast, PCR with Ampdirect A amplified the toxin genes in the mixture containingas much boiled faeces as 0.5% and as few E. coli as 4 to 8 colony-forming units (CFU). The minimum limit for E. coli O157 detection by this method was estimated to be about 104 CFU/g faeces. The results obtained by this direct method agreed well with those obtained by the indirect method using DNA pre-extracted from patients' faeces (the detection limit being 103 CFU/g faeces).</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Improved survival rates in mice that received prophylactic fluids after carcinogen treatment.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  During the development of a model for 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary adenocarcinoma in mice, a high mortality rate was attributed to dehydration. Therefore, we compared the acute survival of mice given subcutaneous fluids prophylactically immediately following DMBA gavage to that of animals provided treatment only when clinical signs of dehydration were observed. Mortality in the prophylactically treated mice was 5% compared to 47% in animals treated only after the manifestation of dehydration. Prophylaxis with subcutaneous fluids significantly reduces mortality in DMBA-treated mice.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>The cytotoxicity of DNA carboxymethylation and methylation by the model carboxymethylating agent azaserine in human cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Carboxymethylating agents are potential sources of endogenous DNA damage that have been proposed as possible contributors to gastrointestinal carcinogenesis. The cytotoxicity of the model DNA carboxymethylating agent azaserine was investigated in human cells. Expression of the DNA repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) did not affect sensitivity to the drug in two related Raji Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. DNA mismatch repair-defective variants of Raji cells which display increased tolerance to DNA methylation damage were not selectively resistant to azaserine. Complementary results were obtained with a second carboxymethylating agent, potassium diazoacetate. In contrast, lymphoblastoid cell lines representative of each of the xeroderma pigmentosum complementation groups, including the variant, were all significantly more sensitive to azaserine than nucleotide excis ion repair-proficient cells. The hypersensitivity of XP cells was not due to systematic differences in the concentrations of intracellular thiol compounds or related thiol metabolizing enzymes. The data indicate that of the two types of potentially lethal DNA damage which azaserine introduces, carboxymethylated bases and O6-methylguanine, the former are repaired by nucleotide excision repair and are a more significant contributor to azaserine lethality in human cells.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>CD14 expression and production by human hepatocytes.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Backgroundims: CD14 has been identified as a receptor for LPS and is present both in a membranebound and a soluble form. Membrane CD14 (mCD14) is predominantly expressed on monocytes, macrophages and granulocytes. The source of soluble CD14 (sCD14) is as yet unclear. Previous investigation using monocytes has shown that sCD14 can be derived either from the shedding of mCD14 or from direct secretion by monocytes. Whether the monocyte is the sole or even the major source of sCD14 is as yet uncertain. Clearance of LPS from the bloodstream is thought to be primarily mediated by the liver. Production of CD14 by hepatocytes would potentially provide a powerful mechanism by which the liver could clear LPS, and therefore we examined the ability of human hepatocytes to produce CD14. Methods: Human hepatocytes were isolated using collagenase perfusion. Results: Human hepatocytes were found to ha ve CD14 mRNA by Northern blot analysis. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining confirmed CD14 protein in primary hepatocyte cultures. Further studies showed that a liver epithelial-like cell line AKN-1 is capable of producing CD14. Comparisons of the size of hepatocyte-derived CD14 protein with the sCD14 protein from the human monocytic leukemia cell line HL60 suggested that a slightly larger form of CD14 is expressed by human liver cells. Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate production of CD14 by human hepatocytes.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Application of DNA arrays to toxicology: Workshop entitled "Application of Microarrays to Toxicology; Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA; January 7-8, 1996; US Environmental Protection Agency.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  DNA array technology makes it possible to rapidly genotype individuals or quantify the expression of thousands of genes on a single filter or glass slide, and holds enormous potential in toxicologic applications. This potential led to a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-sponsored workshop titled "Application of Microarrays to Toxicology" on 7-8 January 1999 in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. In addition to providing state-of-the-art information on the application of DNA or gene microarrays, the workshop catalyzed the formation of several collaborations, committees, and user's groups throughout the Research Triangle Park area and beyond. Potential application of microarrays to toxicologic research and risk assessment include genome-wide expression analyses to identify gene-expression networks and toxicant-specific signatures that can be used to define mode of action, for exposu re assessment, and for environmental monitoring. Arrays may also prove useful for monitoring geneticvariability and its relationship to toxicant susceptibility in human populations.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>The adverse effect of low levels of ambient air pollutants on lung function growth in preadolescent children.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The main purpose of our study was to assess the effect of low concentrations of ambient air pollution on lung function growth in preadolescent children. We accounted for height velocity over the follow-up period and also for other possible confounders such as baseline anthropometric and physiologic characteristics of children. In addition to outdoor air pollution, we considered the possible effects of social class and exposure to indoor pollutants such as gas stove fumes or environmental tobacco smoke. The cohort prospective study was carried out in 1,001 preadolescent children from two areas of Krakow, Poland, that differed in ambient air pollutants. In the city center (higher pollution area), the mean annual level (| standard deviation (SD)) of suspended particulate matter was 52.6 | 53.98 mug/m3 and that of SO2 was 43.87 | 32.69 mug/m3, the corresponding values in the control area were  33.23 | 35.99 mug/m3 and 31.77 | 21.93 mug/m3. Mean lung function growth rate adjustedto height velocity and lung function level at the study entry was significantly lower in boys and girls living in the more polluted areas. Also, the proportion of children with the slower lung function growth (SLFG) was higher in the children from the more polluted area of the city. The analysis completed in the group of children after the exclusion of asthmatic subjects and those with asthmalike symptoms confirmed that, in boys, odds ratios (ORs) for SLFG (forced vital capacity (FVC)) and air pollution after adjustment to baseline FVC, height, and growth rate was significant (OR = 2.15; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.25-3.69)). The analysis also confirmed that for SLFG(FEV1) the OR was 1.90 (CI, 1.12-3.25). The corresponding OR values in girls were insignificant (OR = 1.50; CI, 0.84-2.68 and OR = 1.39;  CI, 0.78-2.44). The association between ambient pollutants and poorer gain of pulmonary volumes in children living in more polluted areas suggests that air pollution in the residence area may be a part of the causal chain of reactions leading to retardation in pulmonary function growth during the preadolescent years.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Daily mortality and air pollution in Santa Clara County, California: 1989-1996.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Since the last revision of the national particulate standards, there has been a profusion of epidemiologic research showing associations between particulates and health effects mortality in particular. Supported by this research, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency promulgated a national standard for particulate matter | 2.5 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5). Nevertheless, the San Francisco Bay Area of California may meet this new standard. This study investigates the relationship between daily mortality and air pollution in Santa Clara County (a Bay Area county) using techniques similar to those utilized in earlier epidemiologic studies. Statistically significant associations persist in the early 1990s, when the Bay Area met national air pollution standards for every criteria pollutant. Of the various pollutants, the strongest associations occur with particulates, especially ammon ium nitrate and PM2.5. The continuing presence of associations between mortality and airpollutants calls into question the adequacy of national standards for protecting public health.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Reanalysis of the effects of air pollution on daily mortality in Seoul, Korea: A case-crossover design.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  We used the case-crossover design to identify any increase in mortality in Seoul, Korea, when there were higher levels of ambient air pollution on case-days than would be expected solely as a result of chance. This empirical study showed that either unidirectional retrospective (selecting only control days prior to death) or prospective (selecting only control days after death) control sampling could cause risk estimates to be confounded by seasonal waves as well as time trends in air pollution levels. In bidirectional control sampling in which exposures at death were compared with exposures both before and after death, the estimated mortality was resistant to confounding by time patterns of air pollution. Using a bidirectional control sampling approach, the results from a conditional logistic regression model controlling for weather conditions showed that the nonaccidental mortality ass ociated with a 50-ppb increment over a 3-day moving average of SO2 concentrations, including the concurrent day and preceding 2 days, was 1.023 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.016-1.084). The relative risk of death was 1.023 (CI, 0.999-1.048) per 50 ppb for 1-hr maximum O3 and 1.010 (CI, 0.988-1.032) per 100 mug/m3 or total suspended particulates. In conclusion, the findings of this study were 2-fold: given the consistency of the observed association between SO2 and daily mortality across different analysis methods, the association reported here indicates that air pollution is a probable contributor to premature death; and bidirectional control sampling is needed in a case-crossover design applied to air pollution epidemiologic studies to control confounding by seasonal patterns of air pollution as well as time trends.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>A case-crossover analysis of air pollution and mortality in Philadelphia.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  This study reassessed Schwartz and Dockery's analysis of daily mortality from nonexternal causes among residents of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, over 8 years, from 1973 to 1980 (American Review of Respiratory Disease 145:600-604 (1992)). A Poisson regression analysis using the same model found that a 100-mug/m3 increment in the 48-hr mean concentration of total suspended particulates (TSP) was associated with increased all-cause mortality (rate ratio = 1.069; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.043-1.096) after adjustment for quadratic trend, season, year, previous day's mean temperature, dew point, winter temperature, and indicators of hot (temperature &gt; 80&amp;#176;F) and humid days (dew point &gt; 66&amp;#176;F). Critics suggested that time-varying factors such as season and day of week were not sufficiently controlled in this analysis and subsequent studies in other locations. We used a conditional logistic re gression analysis with a case-crossover design to reanalyze the data, with air pollution in the prior and subsequent weeks to the day of death serving as referent periods. The case-crossover approach controls for season and day of week by design rather than modeling. We found that a 100-mug/m3 increment in the 48-hr mean level of TSP was associated with increased all-cause mortality (odds ratio (OR) = 1.056; CI, 1.027-1.086) after adjustment for the same weather variables as above. Similar associations were observed for deaths in individuals over 65 years of age (OR = 1.074; CI, 1.037-1.111) and for deaths due to cardiovascular disease (OR = 1.063; CI, 1.021-1.107). The current case-crossover analysis confirms the general conclusion of the previous Poisson regression analysis of an association of TSP with daily mortality in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>The 17-gene ethanolamine (eut) operon of Salmonella typhimurium encodes five homologues of carboxysome shell proteins.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The eut operon of Salmonella typhimurium encodes proteins involved in the cobalamin-dependent degradation of ethanolamine. Previous genetic analysis revealed six eut genes that are needed for aerobic use of ethanolamine; one (eutR), encodes a positive regulator which mediates induction of the operon by vitamin B12 plus ethanolamine. The DNA sequence of the eut operon included 17 genes, suggesting a more complex pathway than that revealed genetically. We have correlated an open reading frame in the sequence with each of the previously identified genes. Nonpolar insertion and deletion mutations made with the Tn10-derived transposable element T-POP showed that at least 10 of the 11 previously undetected eut genes have no Eut phenotype under the conditions tested. Of the dispensable eut genes, five encode apparent homologues of proteins that serve (in other organisms) as shell proteins of th e carboxysome. This bacterial organelle, found in photosynthetic and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, may contribute to CO2 fixation by concentrating CO2 and excluding oxygen. The presence of these homologues in the eut operon of Salmonella suggests that CO2 fixation may be a feature of ethanolamine catabolism in Salmonella.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Purification, properties, and amino acid sequence of a hemoglobinuria-inducing phospholipase A2, MiPLA-1, from Micropechis ikaheka venom.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Dark-colored urine is one of the clinical symptoms of envenomation by Micropechis ikaheka (New Guinea small-eyed snake). We have purified a phospholipase A2, MiPLA-1, which induces dark-colored urine in experimental mice, to homogeneity. The analysis of the dark-colored urine by electrophoresis and N-terminal sequence determination indicated that the color of mouse urine is due to hemoglobin in the urine but not myoglobin. MiPLA-1 is the first hemoglobinuria-inducing toxin. Insignificant hemolytic activity of MiPLA-1 indicates that hemoglobinuria is not due to lysis of erythrocytes by MiPLA-1. This suggests that hemoglobinuria induced by MiPLA-1 may be due to kidney leakage caused by unknown mechanisms. MiPLA-1 also showed other biological effects, including myotoxicity as well as anticoagulant and antiplatelet effects. Structural studies show that MiPLA-1 is a basic protein with a molec ular mass of 14041.60 | 1.78 as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry. We have determinedthe complete amino acid sequence of MiPLA-1. It is a 124-amino-acid protein with a "pancreatic loop" and belongs to group IB phospholipase A2 enzymes. Two short segments flanked by proline brackets are found in the sequence of MiPLA-1. These segments are on the surface of the molecule and hence may be involved in protein-protein recognition.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Superoxide production from paraquat evoked by exogenous NADPH in pulmonary endothelial cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Superoxide production from paraquat in a pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (PMEC) suspension was demonstrated using 2-methyl-6-(p-methoxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroimidazo(1,2-alpha)pyrazin-3-one (MCLA), a chemiluminescence probe, to detect superoxide anions. Increased rates of superoxide production from paraquat, which were sensitive to superoxide dismutase (SOD), required the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) in the reaction medium, and occurred instantaneously after the addition of NADPH, which is impermeable to cell membranes. NADH as an electron donor was not as effective, and xanthine or succinate had no influence. Paraquat was anaerobically reduced in the presence of NADPH and PMECs to yield a one-electron reduced radical, and the reduction was inhibited by NADP+. Diphenyleneiodonium, an inhibitor of flavoprotein reductases, also markedly inhibited  both paraquat reduction and superoxide production. These results indicate that NADPH-dependent superoxide production from paraquat probably occurs by a flavoprotein with NADPH-dependent reductase activity in cell membranes. NADPH-dependent superoxide production from paraquat was also reproduced using adherent PMECs on wells. Under these conditions, superoxide production was enhanced with agonists, including interleukin-1beta, A23187, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The effect of the former two was blocked with staurosporine, while the latter's effect was suppressed with calyculin A.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Tissue concentrations of magnesium in rats receiving various dosages of ethanol.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Ethanol exerts various influences on living organisms. The experiments were conducted in order to determine the influence of ethanol on changes of magnesium concentration in various tissues. The experiment was conducted on white Wistar rats of both sexes. The animals were divided into groups of ten rats each. They received ethanol in their drinking water for 6 weeks. The first group received 5 per cent ethanol, the second received 20 per cent ethanol, the third was the control group and received water. All animals were fed with the same laboratory feed and watered ad libitum. After the duration of the experiment the animals were sacrificed using ketamine. The brain, liver, heart, lung, kidney, spleen, femoral muscle and blood serum were then harvested for further testing. The magnesium concentration was tested in these tissues by using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). Ethanol i n feed causes a shift in the tissue concentration of magnesium. The range of these concentration differences is determined by the dosages as well as by the type of tissue.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>The essential DNA polymerases delta and epsilon are involved in repair of UV-damaged DNA in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  We have studied the ability of yeast DNA polymerases to carry out repair of lesions caused by UV irradiation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By the analysis of postirradiation relative molecular mass changes in cellular DNA of different DNA polymerases mutant strains, it was established that mutations in DNA polymerases delta and epsilon showed accumulation of single-strand breaks indicating defective repair. Mutations in other DNA polymerase genes exhibited no defects in DNA repair. Thus, the data obtained suggest that DNA polymerases delta and epsilon are both necessary for DNA replication and for repair of lesions caused by UV irradiation. The results are discussed in the light of current concepts concerning the specifity of DNA polymerases in DNA repair.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Influenza A among community-dwelling elderly persons in Leicestershire during winter 1993-4; Cigarette smoking as a risk factor and the efficacy of influenza vaccination.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  In a prospective study of community-dwelling people 60-90 years of age, we examined the coverage of influenza vaccine during 1992-3 and 1993-4, the efficacy of vaccination in reducing serologically-confirmed clinical episodes of influenza A during 1993, and the effect of cigarette smoking. During 1992 and 1993, influenza vaccine was given to 106/215 (49 %) and 120/204 (59 %) people with risk conditions, and 84/225 (37 %) and 103/235 (44 %) without risk conditions. Influenza vaccination and general practitioner consultations during 1992 were independent predictors of vaccination in 1993, but current smoking was a negative predictor. Of 209 unimmunized people, 8/35 (23 %) smokers had clinical influenza as compared with 11/174 (6 %) non-smokers (OR 4.4, 95 % CI 1.6 to 11.9). Of 371 non-smokers, 1/197 (0.5 %) vaccinees had influenza as compared with 11/174 (6 %) non-vaccinees (OR 0.075, 95 %  CI 0.587 to 0.009). No cases of influenza occurred among 21 current smokers who were vaccinated.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Cytotoxic actions of the heavy metal chelator TPEN on NG108-15 neuroblastoma-glioma cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Effects of the heavy metal chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) were investigated on cytotoxicity in clonal NG108-15 neuroblastoma-glioma hybrid cells. Three min after addition of 100 muM TPEN, cells began to retract their neurites and lose their characteristic multipolar shape; by 3 - 4 hr of exposure, most cells detached from the substrate, either singly or as variable-sized aggregates. Viability was assessed by monitoring uptake of calcein AM and propidium iodide, fluorescent dyes that served as markers for live and dead cells, respectively. Incubation of cultures in 100 muM TPEN led to a gradual decrease in the population exhibiting calcein fluorescence (viable cells) and a corresponding increase in the population displaying propidium iodide fluorescence (nonviable cells). Loss of cell viability reached 12% at 8 hr, 61% at 24 hr and 83% by 48 hr. Ultrastru ctural examination of TPEN-treated cells revealed condensed chromatin and fragmented nuclei, characteristic of apoptosis, as well as plasma membrane defects and organelle swelling, generally associated with necrosis. Addition of an equimolar concentration of Zn2+ or Cu2+ but not Fe2+ or Mn2+ prevented morphological abnormalities and cell death.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>The involvement of the NMDA receptor complex in the protective effect of anticholinergic drugs against soman poisoning.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Organophosphate poisoning is associated with adverse effects on the central nervous system such as seizure/convulsive activity and long term changes in neuronal networks. This study reports on investigations designed to assess the consequences of soman exposure on excitatory amino acids receptors in the rat brain. In addition, the protective effects of caramiphen which acts at these receptors, and scopolamine, which does not, was determined on soman-induced alteration in rat brain functions. Administration of soman (1 LD50) to pyridostigmine pretreated rats produced seizure activity (measured by EEG monitoring) in all animals tested. Estimation of (3H)MK-801 binding to brain membranes from intoxicated rats revealed a marked decrease in Bmax value 24 but not 2 hrs following soman administration. The specific nature of these effects of soman was demonstrated by the findings that (3H)flunit razepam binding to central benzodiazepine receptors remained unchanged in soman-poisoned rat brain membranes. Both scopolamine and caramiphen, when used prophylactically prevented the lethal effect of soman and completely blocked the development of electrographic seizure activity (EGSA). In contrast, only caramiphen abolished soman-induced modifications in NMDA/ion channel characteristics. Caramiphen displaced (3H)MK-801 bound to the NMDA/ion channel complex, possibly by interacting with the Zn2+ site whereas scopolamine did not. Moreover, caramiphen, but not scopolamine, partially protected mice from NMDA-induced lethality. Thus, it is suggested that an important component of the protective efficacy of caramiphen against organophosphate poisoning might be attributed to its ability to modulate NMDA receptors in addition to its anticholinergic properties.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Prevention of quinone-mediated DNA arylation by antioxidants.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  High performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis showed that the prototype antioxidant ascorbate (vitamin C) inhibits the DNA adducts induced by synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES) and the antiestrogen metabolite 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHTam). Treatment of salmon testes DNA with 4-OHTam quinone or 4-OHTam in the presence of horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generated the same DNA adduct profile. Vitamin C and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhibited the formation of 4-OHTam-dG adducts in a dose-dependent manner. To determine whether the same antioxidants also protect cellular DNA, HL-60 cells were used as cell culture model. Cells treated with 10 muM 4-OHTam in the presence of 1 muM H2O2 for 24 h gave 4-OHTam-dG adducts  4cells with 100 muM 4-OHTam, without H2O2, produced the same level of adducts. Supplementation of the incubation me dia with vitamin C (2.5 mM) or NAC (5 mM) inhibited the formation of DNA adducts. Thus,antioxidants may protect susceptible cells from genotoxicity associated with 4-OHTam activation.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Organochlorine contaminants in microlayer and subsurface water of Alexandria Coast, Egypt.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The surface microlayer of seawater is a potential enrichment site for hydrophobic organic compounds. Concentrations of pesticides and congeners of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the microlayer and subsurface waters of Alexandria coast were assessed. A 0.22 m2 screen was used to collect microlayer samples at 12 stations in June 1997. The samples were analyzed by gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD) and confirmed by GC with mass spectrometry. Ten organochlorine pesticides and 10 PCB congeners were measured. The surface microlayer was enriched 2- to 3-fold in pesticides and PCBs. The most contaminated locations studied were Abu-Quir Bay and the Eastern Harbor. This study provides the first record of residues of PCB congeners in the studied areas and the first data about microlayer enrichment at Alexandria's Mediterranean Coast.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Determination of selenium in meat products by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrophotometry.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Wet digestion using a mixture of nitric, sulfuric, and perchloric acids and an aluminum block digester effectively and rapidly decomposed meat samples for selenium determination by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Digestion did not require constant attention by an operator. Selenium recoveries (range, 94-105%) from National Institute of Standards and Technology standard reference materials and spiked samples were used to validate method accuracy. Coefficients of variation (CVs) of repeatability of in-house reference materials used for precision study were 6.4 and 5.6%, respectively, for seafood mix and mutton liver. Selenium levels in meat products from Brisbane markets varied widely: 0.042-0.142, 0.081-0.42, and 0.050-0.198 mug/g (wet weight) respectively, for beef, chicken, and pork. Overall, selenium levels in manufactured meat ranged from 0.041 to 0.189 mug/g. Th e levels of selenium found in this study were generally lower than those reported in Finland but comparable with those reported in some parts of the United States.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Pesticide residues in selected food commodities: Results from the Danish National Pesticide Monitoring Program 1995-1996.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The paper presents results of analyses of 4182 samples collected from January 1995 to December 1996 for the Danish National Pesticide Monitoring Program. The program basis is a random sample control supplemented with a target control. The objectives of the control are to monitor consumer exposure to health hazards and to enforce national and European Community regulations. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration is responsible for establishing methods, data manipulation, and evaluation, but actual analyses are performed at 4 regional laboratories. In addition to a description of the Danish National Pesticide Monitoring Program on food, the effects of lowering the reporting limits are discussed. Pesticides included are those in current use as well as chlorinated pesticides like lindane, DDT, and HCB, occurring in food now primarily as a result of environmental contamination. Commodi ties analyzed are fruits, vegetables, cereals, bran, fish, and animal products such as meat, butter,cheese, fat, and eggs. In fruits and vegetables, residues were detected in 10% of 2515 samples, with higher incidences of detection for foreign commodities. Violation rate was 0.6%. In food of animal origin, low levels of organochlorine pesticides were detected in most fish samples and in more than half of the animal product samples. However, no results exceeding maximum residue limits were found. No residues of organo-phosphorus pesticides were detected in the 231 meat samples analyzed.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Residues of chlormequat and mepiquat in grain Results from the Danish National Pesticide Survey.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The objective of the present work was to establish information on chlormequat and mepiquat residues in grain for human consumption. Chlormequat (2-chloro-N,N,N-trimethylethylammonium, CAS RN 7003-89-6) and mepiquat (1,1-dimethylpiperidinium, CAS RN 15302-91-7) are plant growth regulators used to stabilize stalks in cereals. The study was part of the Danish National Pesticide Survey, managed by the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration. Samples were collected in autumn 1997. Residue contents were determined with a newly developed liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS) method for chlormequat analysis. The method was extended to include mepiquat in the present study. Quantitation was done by the internal standards method, using mass chromatograms of the most intense daughter ions of mepiquat (m/z 98), chlormequat (m/z 58), and (13C)-chlormequat (m/z 61, internal sta ndard). For chlormequat, the overall limit of detection (LD) was 6 mug/kg and the limitof determination (LOD) was 10 mug/kg. For mepiquat, LD was 2 mug/kg and LOD was 3 mug/kg. Of 77 samples analyzed, 51 contained chlormequat and 11 contained mepiquat. The highest levels of chlormequat were found in samples of oatmeal (3.76 mg/kg) and rye (1.08 mg/kg). In 9 rye grain samples containing chlormequat, 5 also contained mepiquat. However, in all samples analyzed, the residues of chlormequat and mepiquat were below maximum residue limits./METHODS</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Multiresidue screening of pesticides in foods using retention time locking, GC-AED, database search, and GC-MS identification.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Fruit and vegetable extracts were screened for over 400 pesticides by gas chromatography with atomic emission detection (GC-AED) and an experimental database. A technique called retention time locking was used to match GC-AED and GC with mass spectrometry (MS) retention times to those of the database. Samples were analyzed for sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus, and chlorine by GC-AED. Possible pesticides were suggested by database search and identified by GC. Forty-four pesticide standards were analyzed to determine the precision of retention time matching and the accuracy of the database search. Analytical retention times matched database retention times within 0.32 min. Using elemental criteria, the database search identified the correct compound for 41 of 44 pesticide standards. For blind spikes of fruit and vegetable extracts, the database suggested 22 of 26 spiked pesticides as matche s. Nineteen were identified by GC/MS. The combination of retention time locking, GC-AED, database search, and GC/MS can be a powerful tool for identifying pesticides in a complex matrix./METHODS</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Laboratory proficiency testing of aflatoxins in corn and peanuts A cooperative project between Thailand and the United States.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The objective of this project was to conduct an aflatoxin proficiency test program in government, academia, and industry laboratories in Thailand. Aflatoxin-free corn and peanuts and corn and peanuts naturally contaminated with aflatoxins diluted to approximately 25 mug/kg were analyzed. Homogeneity of prepared, naturally contaminated test samples was checked on multiple replicates. The test was conducted according to the ISO/AOAC INTERNATIONAL Harmonized Protocol with z scores indicating laboratory performance. The participants used 3 methods: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, thin-layer chromatography, and the minicolumn. Of 19 laboratories that reported results for aflatoxins in naturally contaminated corn, 13 (68%) performed satisfactorily, on the basis of the mean obtained by an expert laboratory, a calculated target value for standard deviation, and the z score. Of 21 laborat ories that reported results for aflatoxins in naturally contaminated peanuts, 10 (48%) performedsatisfactorily. For aflatoxin-free corn, 6 laboratories reported finding aflatoxins at \10 ng/g, chiefly by the minicolumn method; for aflatoxin-free peanuts, 1 laboratory reported finding aflatoxins at &gt;10 ng/g. Subsequently, a workshop of lectures and laboratory sessions was conducted to improve performance. A new and simple successive outlier removal procedure applied to the same data removed the same laboratories as did the use of z scores.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Molecular systematics of the parasitic protozoan Giardia intestinalis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The long-standing controversy regarding whether Giardia intestinalis is a single species prevalent in both human and animal hosts or a species complex consisting of morphologically similar organisms that differ in host range and other biotypic characteristics is an issue with important medical, veterinary, and environmental management implications. In the past decade, highly distinct genotypes (some apparently confined to particular host groups) have been identified by genetic analysis of samples isolated from different host species. The aim of this study was to undertake a phylogenetic analysis of G. intestinalis that were representative of all known major genetic groups and compare them with other Giardia species, viz. G. ardeae, G. muris, and G. microti. Segments from four "housekeeping" genes (specifying glutamate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, elongation factor 1alpha, and 1 8S ribosomal RNA) were examined by analysis of 0.48-0.69-kb nucleotide sequences determined from DNA amplified in polymerase chain reactions from each locus. In addition, isolates were compared by allozymic analysis of electrophoretic data obtained for 21 enzymes representing 23 gene loci. The results obtained from these independent techniques and different loci were essentially congruous. Analyses using G. ardeae and/or G. muris as outgroups supported the monophyly of G. intestinalis and also showed that this species includes genotypes that represent at least seven deeply rooted lineages, herein designated assemblages A-G. Inclusion of G. microti in the analysis of 18S rRNA sequence data demonstrated the monophyly of Giardia with the same median body morphology but did not support the monophyly of G. intestinalis, instead placing G. microti within G. intestinalis. The findings support t he hypothesis that G. intestinalis is a species complex and suggest that G. microti is a member of this complex.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>The protective action of thymol against carbon tetrachloride hepatotoxicity in mice.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The protective action of thymol (paramethyl-isopropyl-phenol) was investigated against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatotoxicity in male Swiss albino mice. The CCl4 at a dose of 20 mul kg-1 produced damage to liver cells and was followed by the significant increase (P &lt; 0.001) in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity and hepatic lipid peroxidation after 24 h. The hepatocellular necrosis was further confirmed by histopathological examination of liver section. Oral administration of thymol in a single dose (300 mg kg-1) resulted in significant (P &lt; 0.05) amelioration of CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity. Thymol also inhibited lipid peroxidation induced by CCl4 in vivo. The protection offered by thymol was also evident from histopathology photomicrograph. In a separate in vitro assay, thymol inhibited the non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation of normal mice liver homogenate induced by  Fe3+-ascorbate. The present study suggests that thymol protects the liver against CCl4-induced toxicity and the protection may be mediated through its ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation. However, other interactions between thymol and CCl4 remains to be elucidated.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Trends in solid-phase microextraction for determining organic pollutants in environmental samples.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Solid-phase -microextraction (SPME) is a recent technique for sample preparation. It has been used successfully to analyze environmental pollutants in a variety of matrices such as soils, water, and air. SPME is a solvent-free technique which has a number of advantages over more conventional sample preparation techniques such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and solid-phase extraction (SPE). We describe the most recent developments in SPME and some which are being developed, including its coupling to HPLC and CE, the use of new fibers, and the automation of the entire SPME process and its application to field analysis. A summary is given of the most important parameters for applying this extraction technique to the analysis of environmental samples.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Different mechanisms of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-1 (JNK1) activation by ultraviolet-B radiation and by oxidative stressors.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Irradiation of mammalian cells with ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) triggers the activation of a group of stress-activated protein kinases known as c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs). UV-B activates JNKs via UV-B-induced ribotoxic stress. Because oxidative stress also activates JNKs, we have addressed the question of whether the ribotoxic and the oxidative stress responses are mechanistically similar. The pro-oxidants sodium arsenite, cadmium chloride, and hydrogen peroxide activated JNK1 with slow kinetics, whereas UV-B potentiated the activity of JNK1 rapidly. N-acetyl cysteine (a scavenger of reactive oxygen intermediates) abolished the ability of all oxidative stressors tested to activate JNK1, but failed to affect the activation of JNK1 by UV-B or by another ribotoxic stressor, the antibiotic anisomycin. In contrast, emetine, an inhibitor of the ribotoxic stress response, was unable t o inhibit the activation of JNK1 by oxidative stressors. Although UV-A and long wavelength UV-B arethe spectral components of the ultraviolet solar radiation that cause significant oxidative damage to macromolecules, the use of a filter to eliminate the radiation output from wavelengths below 310 nm abolished the activation of JNK1 by UV. Our results are consistent with the notion that UV-B and oxidative stressors trigger the activation of JNK1 through different signal transduction pathways.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Recruitment of ATM protein to double strand DNA irradiated with ionizing radiation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The product of the ATM gene, which is mutated in ataxia telangiectasia, is a nuclear phosphoprotein, and it involves the activation of the p53 pathway after ionizing radiation. Here we show that the ATM protein is constitutively associated with double strand DNA and that the interaction increases when the DNA is exposed to ionizing radiation. The ATM protein also had affinity to restriction endonuclease PvuII-digested DNA, but not to UV-irradiated DNA nor X-irradiated single-stranded DNA. The immunoprecipitation experiment detected very weak association between ATM and DNA-PK proteins, and immunodepletion of DNA-PK showed little or no effect on the interaction of the ATM protein with damaged DNA, indicating that an interaction with DNA-PK might not be required for the recruitment of the ATM protein to damaged DNA. Furthermore, the association was also confirmed in xrs-5 and xrs-6e cells,  which are Chinese hamster ovary mutant cell lines defective in Ku80 function. These results indicate that the ATM protein is recruited to the site of DNA damage and it recognizes double strand breaks by itself or through an association with other DNA-binding protein other than DNA-PK and Ku80 proteins.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Detection of hypoxic cells in murine tumors using the comet assay: Comparison with a conventional radiobiological assay.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The comet (single-cell electrophoresis) assay has been developed as a method for measuring DNA damage in single cells after irradiation. We have developed our own methods and image analysis system for the comet assay to identify hypoxic fractions. In vitro, we tested our system using a cultured tumor cell line (SCCVII). In vivo, we compared the hypoxic fractions detected by this assay with those determined by the in vivo-in vitro clonogenic assay using two rodent tumors (SCCVII3H, EMT6/KU/balb/c), which exhibit different types of hypoxia: acute and chronic. In vitro, our method could differentiate hypoxic cells from oxic cells, using the parameter of tail moment. In vivo, there were good correlations between the hypoxic fractions determined by the comet assay and by the clonogenic assay, in SCCVII/C3H (r=0.85) and in EMT6/KU/balb/c (r=0.75) tumors. By comparison of the two methods in c hronically hypoxic and acutely hypoxic tumors, we further confirmed that the comet assay is clinically useful for estimating hypoxic fractions of solid tumors.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>The diagnosis and treatment of acute acrylonitrile poisoning: A clinical study of 144 cases.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  An analysis of clinical manifestations and emergency treatment of 144 cases of acute acrylonitrile (ACN) poisoning is reported in this article. It is suggested that the acute poisoning induced by inhalation of ACN at high concentrations for a short duration primarily impairs the central nervous system (CNS), and inhalation of ACN at medium concentrations but for a longer period leads to damage to the liver tissues besides the CNS. In severely poisoned victims, the cardiac muscles may be damaged and in the blood levels glutathione (GSH) is decreased. The rational administration of antidotes including the methemoglobin-producing agent (MHbPA), and the sulfur-providing agent (SPA) is the key to the success of emergency treatment and thus the early recovery of the victims.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Effectiveness of sanitizing agents in inactivating Escherichia coli in Golden Delicious apples.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Research was undertaken to develop improved methods of sanitizing apples contaminated with Escherichia coli. Unwaxed Golden Delicious apples, inoculated with nonpathogenic E. coli, were washed with 200 ppm Cl2, commercial washing formulations, 5% H2O2, or combinations of H2O2 with commercial formulations at ca. 20&amp;#176;C or 50&amp;#176;C. Heated commercial formulations achieved a 2.5 log reduction in E. coli load, compared to a 2 log reduction for 200 ppm Cl2. However, heated combinations of H2O2 with acidic surfactants achieved a 3-4 log reduction. Residual H2O2 in treated apples dissipated within several hours. These results demonstrate the efficacy of H2O2 in decontaminating apples containing E. coli.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Bioremediation as an oil spill response tool.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  In the long run, biodegradation is the principal removal mechanism for spilled oil that cannot be collected or burnt. Stimulating biodegradation is thus an important option for maximising the removal of oil from the environment, and minimising the environmental impact of a spill. While oil is still floating on the sea, dispersants maximise the surface area available for microbial attack, and stimulate biodegradation. If oil reaches a shoreline where physical removal is difficult, beach cleaners can aid washing technologies, and minimise the residual oil remaining for biodegradation to remove. Since oils lack nitrogen and phosphorus, the careful application of fertilisers stimulates the biodegradation of residual beached oil in environments where nitrogen and phosphorus are limiting. Taken together, these approaches epitomise modern environmental technologies; working with natural process es to minimise undesirable environmental impacts.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>A field demonstration of the efficacy of bioremediation to treat oiled shorelines following the Sea Empress incident.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Bioremediation was investigated as a method of treating a mixture of Forties Crude Oil and Heavy Fuel Oil stranded on Bullwell Bay, Milford Haven, UK after the grounding of the Sea Empress in 1996. A randomised block design in triplicate was used to test the efficacy of two bioremediation treatments: a weekly application of mineral nutrients dissolved in seawater and a single application of a slow-release fertilizer. Each treatment supplied an equivalent amount of nitrogen and phosphorus. Concentrations of residual hydrocarbons normalised to the biomarker 17alpha(H),21beta(H)-hopane showed that after two months the oil was significantly (p&lt;0.001) more biodegraded in the treated plots than in the controls. On average, the oil in the nutrient amended plots was 37% more degraded than that found in the controls. There was no evidence that the bioremediation treatments increased the toxicity of the  oiled sediment. The results confirm that bioremediation can be used to treat a mixture of crude and heavy fuel oil on a pebble beach. In particular, the data suggest that the application of a slow-release fertilizer alone may be a cost-effective method of treating low-energy, contaminated shorelines after a spill incident.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Effect of nitrogen source on biodegradation of crude oil by a defined bacterial consortium incubated under cold, marine conditions.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Studies have been carried out using a defined bacterial consortium which degrades crude oil under cold, marine conditions. The type of nitrogen supplement (i.e. ammonium versus nitrate) in the artificial sea water medium used in the experiments affected the degree of oil biodegradation observed, and was correlated with spent culture medium pH. Supplementation with ammonium led to progressive acidification of cultures, whereas nitrate amendment resulted in a neutral culture medium. The presence of ammonium in cultures incubated with the full consortium of strains was correlated with decreased aromatic fraction biodegradation, suggesting that aromatic degradation is sensitive to pH and possibly to by-products of saturate fraction biodegradation. The pH effect was shown to be caused primarily by one or more of the three saturate-degrading bacterial strains in the inoculum, when incubated in  the presence of ammonium, while the aromatic-degrading strains did not acidify culture medium to the same degree. Acidification was not linked solely to oil biodegradation, as the inoculum also caused acidification of medium containing glucose and ammonium. The pH effect could be lessened with increased concentrations of phosphate buffer in the medium to maintain a culture pH near neutrality. It was observed that the greatest overall biodegradation occurred with a nitrate supplement and adequate buffering with phosphate.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Nutrient dynamics in marsh sediments contaminated by an oil spill following a flood.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Flood waters during October, 1994, ruptured a group of pipelines that released gasoline, diesel fuel and crude oil into the San Jacinto River near Houston, Texas. This mixture traveled downstream where it ignited inside a flooded house. The resulting fire burned for seven days. A petroleum-contaminated wetland, designated as a research area, received no cleanup during the spill response. Sediment samples collected over a period of one year were analyzed for nutrients and petroleum hydrocarbons. Natural levels of the nutrient analytes were estimated by monitoring the values over a year following the event. Nutrients monitored include ammonium (plus ammonia), nitrate (plus nitrite), available phosphorus, total Kjeldahl nitrogen and total phosphorus in Kjeldahl digest. Available nutrient concentrations were initially high and then declined to presumable background levels of approximately 10  ppm P, 5 ppm N, and 0.5 ppm N for available phosphorus, ammonium, and nitrate, respectively. Average ammonium concentrations were as high as 40 ppm N and average available phosphorus levels were as high as 75 ppm P during December, 1994. Available nutrient levels declined over the period of the study indicating that the system had been enriched. Theories about the source of enrichment include deposition of either nutrient rich sediments from the flood or ashes from the fire. Also, disturbances due to site construction activities involved in building the sampling structures could have contributed to the perturbations observed. During the study, the sum of total petroleum target analytes decreased from approximately 160 ppm to less than 10 ppm. Correlation coefficients of 0.76, 0.75, -0.67, and -0.63 were found between the sum of target analytes and ammonium, available phosphorus, total K jeldahl nitrogen, and total phosphorus in Kjeldahl digest, respectively. These correlation coefficients suggest interdependency between nutrient levels and degradation of the petroleum. The data suggest that the naturally elevated nutrient levels provided favorable conditions for the degradation of the oil.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Pollinosis to Ricinus communis (castor bean): An aerobiological, clinical and immunochemical study.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Background Ricinus communis (castor bean) is a species included into the Euphorbiaceae family, common to all the warm regions of the world. Although the allergenicity of its seed is well known, references are scarce regarding the role played by its pollen as a pneumo-allergen. Objectives To carry out an aerobiological study of this pollen in the Malaga area (southern Spain); describe the physicochemical characteristics of its most relevant allergens; and to demonstrate the existence of patients with respiratory allergy due to this pollen. Methods A Burkard spore trap was used for the aerobiological study from 1992 to 1996. Skin prick tests with castor bean pollen extract were performed to 1946 patients with rhinitis and/or asthma. Specific IgE levels were measured in castor bean-positive SPT patient sera. Immunochemical characterization of the most relevant allergens was performed using  electrophoretic techniques. In vitro cross-reactivity studies using positive patient sera were carried out. Nasal challenge tests were done in 32 subjects randomly selected from the sensitized patient group. Results Castor bean is a perennial pollen with total annual pollen levels never exceeding 1%. One hundred and eighteen (7.7%) patients showed positive prick test (74 rhinitis, 36 rhinitis and asthma, eight asthma). Nine were monosensitized. Specific IgE levels were \ 0.35 PRU/mL in 39 (33%) of patient sera. Nasal challenge test: 10 subjects presented non-specific nasal hyperactivity, 15 were positive and seven negative. The molecular masses and isoelectric points of the main IgE-binding proteins, ranged fromProfilin of the extract was purified by poli-L-proline-Sepharose chromatography and it appeared as one of the most frequent allerg ens. Conclusion Castor bean pollen is an allergen which causes respiratory (mainly nasal) symptoms.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Ethylene glycol developmental toxicity: Unraveling the roles of glycolic acid and metabolic acidosis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  This study sought to determine the relative roles of glycolic acid (GA), a toxicologically important metabolite of ethylene glycol (EG), and metabolic acidosis in causing developmental toxicity in Sprague-Dawley rats. To tease apart these two interrelated factors, we developed an experimental approach in which high blood glycolate levels could be achieved, in either the presence or absence of metabolic acidosis. Initially, rats previously implanted with a carotid artery cannula were given, on gestation day (gd) 10, 40.3 mmol/kg (2500 mg/kg) of EG via gavage, 8.5 mmol/kg (650 mg/kg) of GA via gavage, 8.5 mmol/kg (833 mg/kg) of sodium glycolate (NaG; pH 7.4) via subcutaneous (sc) injection, or distilled water via gavage (control). Peak serum glycolate was nearly identical (8.4-8.8 mM) in the EG, GA, and NaG groups and, as expected, EG and GA caused a metabolic acidosis, but acid base balan ce was normal with NaG. Subsequently, these treatments were given on gd 6-15 to groups of 25 time-mated rats, followed by fetal evaluation on gd 21. EG and GA decreased fetal body weights and caused a similar spectrum of developmental effects, including numerous axial skeleton malformations. NaG treatment also caused slight decreases in fetal body weight, increases in skeletal variations, and totally malformed fetuses. These results indicate that glycolate, in the absence of metabolic acidosis, can cause the most sensitive of EG's developmental effects, whereas metabolic acidosis appears to interact with glycolate at very high doses to markedly enhance teratogenesis. These results support previous studies, which indicated that glycolate is the proximate developmental toxicant for EG, and that GA toxicokinetic parameters can be used to define a quantitative, physiologically based threshol d for EG-induced developmental effects.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>V-Ha-ras gene expression in liver and kidney of transgenic Tg.AC mice following chemically induced tissue injury.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The dermal Tg.AC transgenic mouse line is currently being used as a short-term alternative in vivo model for carcinogenicity screening of drugs and environmental chemicals. These mice carry multiple copies of an activated v-Ha-ras oncogene, making them susceptible to promotionally induced tumorigenesis caused by carcinogen exposure or deep skin wounding. Transgene expression is associated with tumor development in these animals. To determine whether tissue injury in organs other than the skin can induce transgene expression, we characterized the pattern of transgene expression in naive animals as well as mice treated by oral gavage with cytotoxic doses of chloroform. Hepatic BrdU labeling was increased 40-fold in females (240 mg/kg/day) and 20-fold in males (140 mg/kg/day) after 4 days of dosing with chloroform. An increase in renal BrdU labeling (7-fold) was observed only in male Tg.AC  mice. Although chloroform did not induce v-Ha-ras expression, in either the liver or the kidney,a constitutive amount of transgene message was evident in the kidneys of Tg.AC mice. V-Ha-ras transgene expression also correlated with the expression of GATA-3, a transcription factor that binds the zeta-globin (zeta-globin) promoter of the Tg.AC transgene. These studies suggest that chemically induced tissue injury and regenerative cell proliferation per se are not sufficient for the induction of transgene expression in the liver and kidney of Tg.AC mice. Although organs like the kidney may contain the necessary transcription factors for transgene expression, other factors, yet unidentified, may impede v-Ha-ras-mediated tumorigenesis in these tissues.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) selectively disrupt serotonergic cell growth in the developing Spisula embryo.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants that exert neurotoxic effects during embryonic development. The present study demonstrates that early embryonic exposure to a mixture of PCBs (Aroclor 1254) results in a decrease in serotonergic cell growth. Using a novel, marine invertebrate embryo model, Spisula solidissima, immunocytochemistry, and confocal microscopy techniques, a dose-dependent decrease in serotonergic cell number was quantified within 24 h of exposure. This effect was seen with doses as low as 1 ppm Aroclor 1254. These findings demonstrate that environmentally relevant doses of Aroclor 1254 impair development of the serotonergic nervous system.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Enterotoxigenicity of Klebsiella pneumoniae associated with childhood gastroenteritis in Madras, India.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated as the predominant growth from 12 of 100 children under 3 years of age suffering from acute diarrhea. Of the 12 isolates, SA1, SA2, SA4, SA5, SA6 produced a secretogenic response in the ligated rabbit ileal loop, and one isolate, SA3, induced a diarrheagenic response in suckling mice. Two isolates, SA7 and SA8, were diarrheagenic in both assays. Strains SA9, SA10, SA11, and SA12 were found to be non-enterotoxigenic. These isolates belonged to serotypes K6, 16, 25, 30, 39, 46, 49, 53, 66, and 81. All eight enterotoxigenic strains were resistant to ampicillin, streptomycin, ceftazidime, cefuroxime, and cotrimoxazole. Only quinolones such as ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin appear to be effective against enterotoxigenic K. pneumoniae.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>A convergent synthesis of the trans-fused hexahydrooxonine ring system and reproduction of conformational behavior shown by ring F of ciguatoxin.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  A new strategy for the construction of the fused hexahydrooxonine ring system has been developed. The present synthesis involves an intramolecular reaction of gamma-alkoxyallylsilane with acetal to form an O-linked oxacycle and a SmI2-mediated intramolecular Reformatsky reaction for constructing an oxonane ring as the key steps. Thermodynamic behavior of the trans-fused hexahydrooxonine ring was clarified for the first time and the conformational alternation was reproduced in the 6-9-6 tricyclic model compound 1 as was observed for that in the ciguatoxin molecule (ring F).</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>The evolution of mass balance models of persistent organic pollutant fate in the environment.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Current approaches to modelling the fate of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the environment have evolved in response to four dominant characteristics of these substances; namely: (1) the presence of POPs in virtually all environmental phases and the ease with which they move from one to the other requires multi-compartmental modelling. Describing transport across phase boundaries becomes as, or even more, important as quantifying transport within the phases; (2) POPs may persist in the environment for many decades. For chemicals that 'have time', concepts such as equilibrium partitioning and steady-state become more important than for short-lived substances whose fate is more controlled by the rates of transformation; (3) measuring POPs is difficult and expensive and observed concentrations of POPs are not available in high spatial or temporal resolution. Consequently, high resol ution tends not to be a high priority in POP models; and (4) detrimental effects of POPs often manifest themselves in top predators, which has led to a focus on modelling biotic uptake and transfer within food chains. The task of building a POPs model is viewed as combining the four 'building blocks' of partitioning, transport, transformation and source data with the help of the law of the conservation of mass. Process models, evaluative models, models of real local, regional and global fate, as well as biological uptake models are presented and references to numerous examples are provided. An attempt is made to forecast future directions in the field of POPs modelling. It is expected that modelling techniques that do not rely on quantitative emission estimates as well as approaches that take into account spatial, temporal and climatic variability as well as parameter uncertainty will in crease in importance. Finally, the relationship between modelling POPs and models of other pollutant issues is addressed, as are potential interactions between POPs and pollutant issues such as eutrophication, acidification and global climate change.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Predictive modeling of effects under global change.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The status of computer simulation models from around the world for evaluating the possible ecological, environmental, and societal consequences of global change is presented in this paper. In addition, a brief synopsis of the state of the science of these impacts is included. Issues considered include future changes in climate and patterns of land use for societal needs. Models discussed relate to vegetation (e.g. crop), soil, bio-geochemistry, water, and wildlife responses to conventional, forecasted changes in temperature and precipitation. Also described are models of these responses, alone and interactively, to increased CO2, other air pollutants and UV-B radiation, as the state of the science allows. Further, models of land-use change are included. Additionally, global multiple sector models of environment, natural resources, human population dynamics, economics, energy, and politic al relations are reviewed for integrated impact assessment. To the extent available, information oncomputer software and hardware requirements is presented for the various models. The paper concludes with comments about using these technologies as they relate to ecological risk assessment for policy decision analysis. Such an effort is hampered by considerable uncertainties with the output of existing models, because of the uncertainties associated with input data and the definitions of their dose-response relationships. The concluding suggestions point the direction for new developments in modeling and analyses that are needed for the 21st century.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Global change: State of the science.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Only recently, within a few decades, have we realized that humanity significantly influences the global environment. In the early 1980s, atmospheric measurements confirmed basic concepts developed a decade earlier. These basic concepts showed that human activities were affecting the ozone layer . Later measurements and theoretical analyses have clearly connected observed changes in ozone to human-related increases of chlorine and bromine in the stratosphere. As a result of prompt international policy agreements, the combined abundances of ozone-depleting compounds peaked in 1994 and ozone is already beginning a slow path to recovery. A much more difficult problem confronting humanity is the impact of increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases on global climate. The processes that connect greenhouse gas emissions to climate are very complex. This complexity has limited  our ability to make a definitive projection of future climate change. Nevertheless, the range of projected climate change shows that global warming has the potential to severely impact human welfare and our planet as a whole. This paper evaluates the state of the scientific understanding of the global change issues, their potential impacts, and the relationships of scientific understanding to policy considerations.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Photochemical oxidants: State of the science.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Atmospheric photochemical processes resulting in the production of tropospheric ozone (O3) and other oxidants are described. The spatial and temporal variabilities in the occurrence of surface level oxidants and their relationships to air pollution meteorology are discussed. Models of photooxidant formation are reviewed in the context of control strategies and comparisons are provided of the air concentrations of O3 at select geographic locations around the world. This overall oxidant (O3) climatology is coupled to human health and ecological effects. The discussion of the effects includes both acute and chronic responses, mechanisms of action, human epidemiological and plant population studies and briefly, efforts to establish cause-effect relationships through numerical modeling. A short synopsis is provided of the interactive effects of O3 with other abiotic and biotic factors. The ov erall emphasis of the paper is on identifying the current uncertainties and gaps in our understanding of the state of the science and some suggestions as to how they may be addressed.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Effects of coating conditions on release profiles of controlled release granules coated with water insoluble polymer.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  We prepared capsule-type controlled release granules coated by water insoluble polymer, in which metominostrobin was used as a model agrochemical. In this study, the effects on release profiles of a) coating processes and b) content of polymer were evaluated at the equal amounts of the polymer. For coating, the release rate of metominostrobin from the granules coated with the polymer (solid content: 50%) by dropping process (D-1) was faster than that from the granules by fluidized bed process (F-1). For the solid content, the order of release rate from the granules was F-1 &gt; F-2 which was coated with the aqueous dispersion containing 5% solid content of the polymer by fluidized bed process. Superposition analysis on the release rates revealed that the difference in release mechanisms was dependent on the solid content of polymer but not on coating processes. Observation by SEM suggested  that the release rate and release mechanism could correlate to each other and be related with the surface structure of the granules.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Nasal reactivity to capsaicin in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis during and after the pollen season.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Background: We aimed to study the participation of neurogenic mechanisms in nasal allergic inflammation by assessing the effect of neurogenic stimulation on the secretory and cellular responses of nasal mucosa in patients with allergic rhinitis. Methods: A group of patients suffering from seasonal allergic rhinitis was challenged intranasally with incremental doses of capsaicin (0.3, 3, 12 mug) during and after the pollen season. Clinical symptoms after provocations were monitored, and unilateral nasal lavages were obtained. The nasal lavage fluid (NAL) was assayed for concentration of total protein, albumin, lactoferrin, and number of leukocytes, following by differential count. Results: Capsaicin challenge during the pollen season produced greater congestion (P&lt;0.01) and rhinorrhea (P&lt;0.05) than after the season. The intensity of burning sensation (pain) was similar on both occasions. C apsaicin failed to increase albumin content in NAL both during and after the season. Total protein was increased only after the highest dose of capsaicin (P&lt;0.03) after the season. The number of eosinophils in basal lavages was higher during the season. During the season, the total number of leukocytes at least doubled in 7/12 patients and the percentage of eosinophils increased in 6/12 patients after the capsaicin challenge. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that during the symptomatic period the nasal mucosa of allergic patients is more susceptible to neurogenic stimulation, showing enhanced secretory and inflammatory (cellular) responses.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Solid phase extraction (SPE) for multi-residue analysis of beta2-agonists in bovine urine.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Solid phase extraction (SPE) for the treatment of bovine urine samples in the analysis of beta2-agonist multi-residues by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was evaluated. Mabuterol, mapenterol, clenproperol, terbutaline, clenbuterol, salbutamol, clenpenterol, bromobuterol and hidroxi-metilclenbuterol (NA1141) were tested with five different mechanisms: adsorption, reverse phase, polar, ion exchange, and mixed phase, and eleven sorbents: diatomaceous earth, octadecyl (C18), octyl (C8), native silica (Si), diol (2OH), amine (NH2), trimethylaminopropyl (SAX), propylbenzenesulphonic (SCX), Bond Elut Certify  (C8+SCX), Clean Screen DAU  (CSDAU) and Multimode (C18+SCX+SAX). Recoveries of the nine beta2-agonists from urine samples spiked at 20 ng mL-1 using metoprolol as internal standard were in ranges of 2.9% to 58.1%, of 12.0% to 60.7%, of 6.3% to 31.3%, of 3.3% to 56.8% and of 17.7% to  66.9%, respectively for adsorption, non polar, polar, ion exchange, and multiple extraction mechanisms. The coefficients of variation (C.V.) were also evaluated and discussed. The proposed study show that mixed phase sorbents, especially those which combine hydrophobic and strong cationic exchange interactions, were recommended for a beta2-agonist multi-residue solid phase extraction procedure from bovine urine.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Chrysophyte cysts as paleolimnological indicators of environmental change due to cottage development and acidic deposition in the Muskoka-Haliburton region, Ontario, Canada.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Chrysophyte cysts preserved in recent and pre-industrial lake sediment samples from 54 Muskoka-Haliburton (Ontario) lakes were used in a paleolimnological study to determine the impact of acidic precipitation and cottage development on water quality. A total of 246 cyst morphotypes were identified. Ecological preferences of cyst morphotypes were determined using multivariate statistical analysis, cluster analysis, and species-environment correlations. Recent cyst assemblages were related to water chemistry and lake morphometric variables using Redundancy Analysis (RDA). The distribution of morphotypes was related to a gradient of acid neutralising capacity (ANC), expressed through the association of variables related to buffering (i.e. longitude, watershed area, and ionic concentration) with the first axis (lambda1 = 0.29). Cyst assemblages were also defined, to a lesser extent (lambda2 = 0.06), b y a trophic status gradient, created through the combination of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), volume-weighted cottage density, and lake depth variables. The identification of lakewater pH and trophic status as important determinants of cyst assemblage structure allowed for the reconstruction of acidification and eutrophication related water chemistry changes using fossil cyst assemblages. The reconstruction of pre-industrial (pre-1850) water quality conditions with fossil cyst assemblages indicated that pH significantly decreased in 24.1% of the study lakes and increased in 16.7% of the lakes. Increases in pH in more alkaline drainage basins are attributed to alkalinity generation processes induced by acidic precipitation as has been shown in other studies. Total phosphorus (TP) concentrations significantly declined in 12.9% of the lakes and increased in 16.6% of lakes. Inc reases in (TP) were linked to cottage development. Decreases in trophic status may be due to landuse changes, the result of the acidification occurring in the area, or warmer and drier climates.A comparison of chrysophyte cyst and diatom water quality inferences show similar trends in pH changes. There is a good agreement between diatom and chrysophyte bioindicators with respect to (TP) changes in oligotrophic lakes (&lt; 10 mug); however, diatom inferences suggest that lakes with current (TP) values greater than 10 mug/L have decreased in trophic status over time, while chrysophyte reconstructions suggest that these same lakes have become more productive systems.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Hay fever, eczema, and wheeze: A nationwide UK study (ISAAC, international study of asthma and allergies in childhood).</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Objectives To describe the prevalence of atopic symptoms in children throughout the UK. Method A questionnaire survey of 12-14 year olds throughout England, Wales, Scotland, and the Scottish Islands using the international study of asthma and allergies in childhood (ISAAC) protocol. Results A total of 27 507 (86%) children took part. Recent rhinoconjunctivitis was reported by 18.2%, with 6.2% reporting symptoms between March and September; 16.4% reported itchy flexural rash in the past 12 months. The prevalence of atopic symptoms was higher in girls and subjects born within the UK. The prevalence of severe wheeze was highest in subjects reporting perennial rhinoconjunctivitis, as opposed to summertime only symptoms. Winter rhinoconjunctivitis was associated with severe wheeze and severe flexural rash. One or more current symptoms were reported by 47.6% of all children and 4% reported all  three symptoms. Conclusion In general, geographical variations were small but the prevalence ofsymptoms was significantly higher in Scotland and northern England. The study demonstrates the importance of atopic diseases both in their own right and in association with asthma.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Effects of clearfell harvesting on lucanid beetles (Coleoptera: Lucanidae) in wet and dry sclerophyll forests in Tasmania.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The effects of commercial forestry harvest and regeneration practices (clearfelling and slash-burning) on the lucanid fauna of the wet sclerophyll forests of southern Tasmania and the dry sclerophyll forests of eastern Tasmania were examined using pitfall catches. Lucanids are saproxylic beetles, dependent on dead, moribund and decaying wood. Samples taken from old-growth forest and from a chronosequence of sites regenerating after logging, in each forest type, were used to compare the species richness and abundance of the lucanid assemblages. In both forest types, species richness and abundance was highest in the youngest regeneration sites (1-3 year), reflecting the species richness of the original and adjacent unlogged forest, lowest in the older (20-25 year) sites, and variable in the old-growth sites. TWINSPAN cluster analysis showed no clear distinction between regeneration and old -growth forest. The post-harvest slash and stump residue provided an important refugium and initialhabitat, but our research indicates that some species may not maintain populations in the long term. Our results suggest that most species of lucanids will find a continuous supply of suitable habitat only in old-growth forests; and such species may become less common as clearfell harvesting leads to a replacement of heterogeneous old-growth forest with single-aged monospecific stands. Continuity of supply of wood in all decay stages, the maintenance of sufficient source areas, and biological connectivity between old-growth stands to enable dispersal, are all likely to be essential to maintain lucanid beetle community integrity. If similar principles apply to other saproxylic species of invertebrate, then clearfelling and slash-burning may cause a gradual extinction of an important element  of the forest biota.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Effect of lupeol, a pentacyclic triterpene from Crataeva nurvala, on nephrotoxicity induced by cadmium in rats.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  We have tested lupeol, a pentacyclic triterpene, for its protective action against cadmium-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. Following cadmium administration (1 mg/kg body weight), urine was collected to study the renal damage induced by cadmium by measuring any changes in enzymatic activities. The levels of protein and nucleic acids, and activities of marker enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase), were significantly lower in the kidney tissue of cadmium administered rats when compared to controls. The levels of nitrogenous compounds (urea, uric acid and creatinine) in the blood were significantly higher in cadmium-exposed rats. Urinary parameters reflected perturbation in the renal membrane, as evidenced by significant elevation in nitrogenous compounds and enzymes following cadmium administration. Lupeol treatment along with cadmium resulted in near-no rmal enzyme activities, indicating protection of the kidney against cadmium-induced renal damage.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Alcohol and mortality in Russia: Is it different than elsewhere?</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  PURPOSE: To discuss the hypothesis that alcohol, and binge drinking in particular, is a major determinant of the recent mortality fluctuations in Russia. METHODS: Discussion based on published literature. RESULTS: The hypothesis is based on circumstantial evidence. The changes in mortality coincided with introduction and collapse of the Soviet anti-alcohol campaign. The largest relative changes in mortality were observed for "alcohol-related causes" (a specific diagnostic category used in Russia) as well as violent and accidental deaths, but the largest absolute changes were observed for cardiovascular causes which had the largest impact on all-cause mortality. There is no direct support for the hypothesis. Available estimates of alcohol consumption in Russia are low, and the only published study on alcohol and mortality conducted in Russia produced negative results. Increase in drinking  prevalence alone would not explain the mortality rise; increase in relative risk related to alcoholwould also be needed. The biological mechanisms which could underlie the presumed strong effects of alcohol on heart disease are not clear. On the other hand, binge drinking has not been addressed adequately by research so far. CONCLUSIONS: Until a well designed study is conducted in Russia, the hypothesis remains debatable.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Relationship between the maximum standing crop of musty-odor producing algae and nutrient concentrations in the southern basin water of Lake Biwa.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  In order to make clear the growth characteristics of musty-odor producing algae (Oscillatoria tenuis, Phormidium tenue and Anabaena macrospora), we examined the correlation between the maximum growth number (MGN) of each alga and nutrient concentrations, with the unialgal culture method using a 0.45mum pore size membrane-filtered lake water. We found that the MGN of Lake Biwa water was limited by soluble phosphorus concentration. In order to verify the results, we examined out the relation between the maximum standing crop (MSC) of musty-odor producing algae in the southern basin of Lake Biwa and nutrient concentrations of our 12-year (1983-1994) observation data. The MSC of P. tenue showed a positive correlation with the N:P ratio. On the other hand, The MSC of O. tenuis showed a strong positive correlation with the phosphorus concentration, and a positive correlation with the iron and s oluble phosphorus concentration, but a strong negative correlation with the N:P ratio. When the phosphorus concentration is over 0.030 mg/l, O. tenuis will probably be over 10 filaments/mL. The optimum N:P ratio range was 10 to 20.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Advances in treatment processes to solve off-flavor problems in drinking water.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  There have been significant advances in the development and application of treatment processes to control off-flavor problems in drinking water in the past few years. This paper updates two major treatment process summaries that appeared in 1988 and 1995. The paper also puts the efficiencies of the treatment processes in perspective by using the drinking water flavor wheel as a reference point. Removal or control of classes of off-flavor problems are described in relation to the categories on the wheel. Specifically, processes such as oxidation, adsorption, biological treatment and membranes are described. The recent literature is reviewed and advances in treatment are identified. A new treatment process for controlling nitrification in distribution systems is introduced which has the potential to dramatically reduce the problems of chlorinous odor complaints from customers.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Distribution-generated taste-and-odor phenomena.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The objectives of this study were to investigate various distribution conditions that directly affect the production of tastes and odors, identify the chemical causes, and develop guidelines to help water utilities solve or prevent these types of problems. This paper presents four case studies of taste-and-odor problems generated in distribution systems. Two types of problems will be presented, (1) problems that occur in association with pipe or reservoir lining material leaching into the water and (2) problems that are caused by a continuation of chemical reactions in the water within the distribution system. The sensory method used was flavor profile analysis (FPA) and the chemical methods were closed loop stripping analysis (CLSA) or liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC). Bromophenols and bromodichloroiodomethanes were found to be the  cause of the medicinal odors, while alkyl benzenes and naphthalene were found to be associated withthe oil-base paint type of odors./METHODS</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Efficacy of bank filtration for the removal of fragrance compounds and aromatic hydrocarbons.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The elimination of fragrance compounds by bank filtration was studied in a suboxic aquifer. Fragrance compounds were the major volatile organic compounds (VOC) in river water (Neckar Germany) and were accompanied by aromatic hydrocarbons. Typical fragrance compounds were menthol, limonene, aterpineol, 4-tert.butylcyclohexanol and 4-tert.butylcyclohexanone. Bank filtration reduced the concentrations of these compounds near to or below their detection limit. The reduction of concentrations in the aquifer was primarily found in the first meters from the river. The concentrations of the aromatic hydrocarbons were reduced to nanogram per liter levels./METHODS</AbstractText>

<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Odor produced by breakpoint chlorination in a drinking water purification process was researched. Ammonia and six amino acids (glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, arginine, proline) were chlorinated and production of odor and its change were investigated. An intense odor which was different to the odor of residual free chlorine was detected after the chlorination of ammonia. The production of the odor was affected by pH and chlorine dose rate. While the intense odor was not produced in the breakpoint chlorination at pH 8.3, a weak odor before the breakpoint and the intense odor after the breakpoint were produced at pH 6.5. At pH 3.0, the intense odor was detected even in a sample of low chlorine dose rate. An identification of the intense odor substance was done using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer and trichloramine or a dimer of dichloramine was suspected as the odor causing subst ance. In chlorination of the six amino acids, the intense odor and its change were different according to each amino acid. Production of chlorinated intermediate and final products which had a different odor were suspected as one of the reasons.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Formation of dimethyloligosulfides in Lake Kinneret.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Dimethyloligosulfides were recently identified as a primary source of mild malodorous emissions from Lake Kinneret, Israel. The seasonal odor episodes coincide with a bloom of Peridinium gatunense algae. The possibility that the dimethyloligosulfides are formed by bacterial degradation of Peridinium gatunense lysis products, under oxygen rich conditions was investigated. Several bacterial strains were isolated from the lake. Addition of Peridinium cells to the isolated bacteria cultures yielded dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide. One of the bacteria strains, identified as Acinetobacter lwoffii, an obligatory aerobe was singled out for detailed investigation. Addition of Peridinium cells or methionine to the Acinetobacter culture yielded, under aerobic conditions dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide. Cystein feed yielded only inorganic oligosulfides, which were converted to dime thylsulfides by addition of d3-methyliodide.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Odorous compounds in wastewater reservoir used for irrigation.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The objective of this study was to investigate the odor and physicochemical characteristics of a model deep wastewater reservoir (the Na'an reservoir). Depth sampling of the reservoir revealed depletion of oxygen and increase of hydrogen sulfide and organic nitrogen and sulfur odorous compounds at deeper levels of the reservoir. TOC, TON, BOD5 and chromatographic fingerprinting by MSD and Olfactory of the semivolatile organic compounds in the reservoir were found to be season dependent. Late summer was found to be the most odorous period and the richest in semi-volatile compounds. A list of volatile compounds, which were identified by gas chromatography, in the reservoir water and in the surrounding atmosphere was compiled./PHYSIOLOGY</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Biosynthesis of bromophenols in marine algae.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The green marine alga Ulva lactuca is known to contain high concentrations of bromophenols. However, the biosynthetic pathways of their formation is not known. This study was aimed at identifying possible precursors of bromophenols. The bromophenol content and bromoperoxidase activity were measured in the alga collected every month from January to August 1997. Bromoperoxidases were extracted and incubated with various possible precursors of bromophenols and brominated reaction products were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results show that U. lactuca contains a bromoperoxidase which can convert phenol, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol to bromophenols. L-tyrosine and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde could not be converted to bromophenols. Bromophenol content and bromoperoxidase activity exhibited a seasonal variation with high productivity in summer and low i n winter.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Flavor profile analysis and GC-MS detection of phenolic iodinated disinfection byproducts in drinking water for the USA space program.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Reactions of iodine and phenol were investigated to determine which iodophenols were produced and their odor properties. The research was performed in support of the USA space program that applies iodine to disinfect potable water for spacecraft use. Higher concentrations (50 mg/1) and higher iodine:phenol (e.g. 10:1) ratios resulted in the formation of greater iodophenol concentrations and higher substituted iodophenols. The reactions were fast and nearly complete within 1 hour. For pH 5.5 and 8 and all iodine:phenol ratios, formation of monosubstituted compounds indicated that 2-iodophenol was favored over 4-iodophenol. At the intermediate iodine:phenol ratios of 1:1 and 2:1, substantial amounts of the diiodophenols formed and persisted for up to 32 days. The diiodophenols were not detected at iodine:phenol ratios of 0.2:1 and 10:1. The compound 2,4,6-triiodophenol was the major produc t formed at a 10:1 iodine:phenol ratio and the formation of this trisubstituted phenol appeared nearly complete. Odor evaluation indicated that the iodophenols have much lower odor threshold concentrations (OTC) than phenol. The 2- and 4- iodophenol had OTC values oficinal, phenol, chemical".</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Bench-scale evaluation of adsorptive processes for taste and odors control using rapid small-scale column tests and flavor profile analysis.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The City of Appleton, Wisconsin operates an 800 1/s Drinking Water Treatment Plant (WTP). Lake Winnebago serves as the source water which experiences algae blooms that are typically accompanied by severe taste and odor (T&amp;O) episodes. Historically, raw water quality in the summer months prevents the full capacity from being achieved despite the use of potassium permanganate, powdered activated carbon (PAC) and granular activated carbon (GAC) filters. Thus, the City proceeded with a study of various treatment processes to mitigate the T&amp;O problems experienced during the summer months. The relatively short duration of T&amp;O episodes and extensive experimental plan necessitated a bench-scale testing for rapid evaluation of various oxidation and adsorptive processes. This paper presents a review of the effect of carbon type, dosage, contact time, and application point on the performance of PAC  in controlling odors. In addition, the effect of GAC type and empty bed contact time (EBCT) on removal of T&amp;O compounds were evaluated using a rapid small scale column test (RSSCT).</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>An aesthetic quality index for Barcelona's water supply.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The application of an aesthetic quality index is proposed for distribution water. This index is expressed by a dimensionless number between zero and ten and it is calculated by a formula in which taste and odour, turbidity and colour take part. A sub-index has previously been defined for each of these parameters and the global index is a weighted average of all of them. The taste and odour are determined by Flavour Profile Analysis.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Weathering, biomass production and groundwater chemistry in an area of dominant anthropogenic influence, the Chaves-Vila Pouca de Aguiar region, north of Portugal.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Using a combination of a grouping algorithm and a geochemical mole balance algorithm, we could identify and quantify the contributions made by water-rock and water-biomass interactions to the composition of shallow groundwaters in northern Portugal, in an area with a sizable anthropogenic input (the Chaves-Vila Pouca de Aguiar region). The first algorithm, based on the mathematical concept of equivalent relations, allows for the grouping of water samples with similar chemistries. The second algorithm, which uses the stoichiometries and mole/charge balances in weathering reactions and biological processes, provides the possibility to relate the average chemistry of each identified group to water-mineral and water-biomass interactions. This algorithm hinges on ratios of dissolved silica and bicarbonate, constituents considered to be derived only from chemical weathering and biomass product ion. Background information on the petrology, mineralogy and chemistry of bedrocks and soils, on climatic differences, on the history of deforestation and reforestation of the study area, and on the application and composition of fertilizers and manure, was used to identify the most realistic weathering reactions and biological processes which contribute to the water chemistry. The concentrations of chloride, sulphate and nitrate were considered to represent sources other than chemical weathering or biomass changes, like cyclic salts, fertilizers and manure. Despite the high background concentrations derived from such sources, we were able to quantify the contributions of the identified weathering reactions and botanical uptake to the groundwater composition. The spatial distributions of the various groundwater groups shows a good correlation with the geology, land use and climatic diffe rences in the area.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Magnetic separation of ferrite sludge from a wastewater purification process.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The purification of wastewater containing dissolved metal ions by in situ precipitation gives rise to a sludge composed mainly of ferrites MeXFe3-xO4 (where Me represents the existing metal ions in the wastewater). Oxides, iron oxy-hydroxides and other impurities are also present in the sludge in smaller proportion. The present investigation proposes magnetic separation of the sludge to recover the ferrites for their possible re-use. Under optimum operating conditions of the magnetic separator, a recovery efficiency of the magnetic fraction in excess of 99% and a high degree of selectivity were obtained.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Utilization of petrochemical industry waste water for agriculture.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of petrochemical industry waste water on certain physico-chemical properties of soil and on growth, yield and quality of corn (Zea mays L.) and mustard (Brassica juncea L. Czern and Coss). The pH of the waste water was near about neutral but it contained a higher amount of nitrogen, potassium, phosphate, sodium, chloride, calcium, carbonates, bicarbonates and suspended and dissolved solids when compared with fresh water. Soil receiving the waste water showed no significant changes in water soluble salts, electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity, pH, total organic carbon etc. Moreover, waste water irrigation resulted in increased growth and yield of both the crops. Thus, it may be concluded that the petrochemical industry waste water may be used profitably for the cultivation of corn and mustard.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Volatile organic compounds in the ambient air of Rousse, Bulgaria.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Volatile organic compounds in the ambient air were measured at four locations in Rousse, Bulgaria for a one year period. A gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic concentrator was used to analyse the air samples. Forty one compounds (aromatic hydrocarbons and halogen-derivatives of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons) were analysed by EPA method TO-14. Aromatic hydrocarbons, benzene, toluene, styrene, isomers of xylene and isomers of trimethyl benzene were the most frequently occurring pollutants. Styrene, isomers of xylene and isomers of trimethyl benzene frequently exceeded the concentration limits. Among the halogen derivatives, the concentration of chloroform was always very high. A concept called 'degree of pollution' was proposed to clarify the contribution of each pollutant to the total air-pollution. Suggestions were made on the need to introduce an integral  tolerance parameter to describe the total impact on air-pollution.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Behaviour of cyanides in soil and groundwater: A review.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Most people associate the word cyanide with an extremely dangerous and fast-acting poison. However, there are several cyanide species, of varying toxicity, depending on the source to cyanide contamination. The most important cyanide compounds, as well as the most important sources of cyanide contamination in soils and groundwater are discussed. Toxicological and analytical aspects of cyanide containing compounds are briefly touched. The behaviour of cyanide compounds in soil and groundwater is governed by many interacting chemical and microbial processes. Redox conditions and pH are of importance for the leaching and degradation of iron cyanide complexes. Free cyanide is degraded under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, while documentation of the degradability of iron cyanide complexes only exists under aerobic conditions. The risk associated to the cyanide contained in the different  types of sources is evaluated. At gas work sites, where cyanide is mainly present as iron cyanide complexes, the risk for effects on humans from exposure to cyanide compounds seems to be of minor relevance.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Implementing atmospheric fate in regulatory risk assessment of pesticides: (How) can it be done?</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Atmospheric fate of pesticides and their possible effects in ecosystems beyond the immediate surrounding of the application site are not actively considered in currently used regulatory risk assessment schemes. Concern with respect to atmospheric transport and subsequent deposition of pesticides in non-target areas is however growing. In this article the results of discussions on the possibilities of implementing atmospheric fate in regulatory risk assessment are presented. It is concluded that implementing atmospheric fate in regulatory risk assessment schemes is possible and that, from a scientific point of view, these schemes should distinguish between pesticides on the basis of both their possibility/probability to reach non-target areas and on their toxicity. This implies that application of the precautionary principle or use of intrinsic pesticide properties alone is not considered  justifiable. It is recommended that the risk assessment scheme should follow a tiered approach. Thefirst tier should be entered only if the existing regulatory risk assessment procedure, including a local PEC:PNEC calculation, has been passed and involves a test for the pesticide's total atmospheric emission potential, i. e. its potential for becoming airborne during and after application. The second tier, which is only entered if the total emission potential is higher than a certain trigger value, should consist of a PEC:PNEC calculation of regional off-site areas (10-50 km) (tier 2A). If the pesticide's atmospheric transport potential is expected to exceed a certain value, the PEC:PNEC ratio should also be calculated for more remote areas (&gt; 1000 km) (tier 2B).</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Atmospheric transport and deposition of pesticides: An assessment of current knowledge.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The current knowledge on atmospheric transport and deposition of pesticides is reviewed and discussed by a working group of experts during the Workshop on Fate of pesticides in the atmosphere; implications for risk assessment, held in Driebergen, the Netherlands, 22-24 April, 1998. In general there is a shortage of measurement data to evaluate the deposition and reemission processes. It was concluded that the mechanisms of transport and dispersion of pesticides can be described similarly to those for other air pollution components and these mechanisms are rather well-known. Large uncertainties are present in the exchange processes at the interface between air and soil/water/vegetation. In all process descriptions the uncertainty in the physicochemical properties play an important role. Particularly those in the vapour pressure, Henry's law constant and its temperature dependency. More ac curate data on physicochemical properties and particularly the temperature dependencies is needed.</AbstractText>

<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The current knowledge about transformation rates and products of pesticides in the atmosphere is reviewed. Reactive species and their concentrations in the atmosphere are presented. Reactions of pesticides with these species (including photolysis) in the gas and the particulate phase are evaluated from available experimental data. The potential of estimation methods is discussed. Experimental techniques for laboratory and outdoor measurements are reviewed. Finally, an estimation is made of uncertainties in atmospheric lifetimes due to chemical or physical reactions. It is concluded that the most important transformation of pesticides in the atmosphere is due to reaction with OH radicals. Very few experimental data for pesticides are available though. The levels of uncertainty in OH radical concentrations are acceptable, however, for a proper estimation of atmospheric removal rates due to  reactions with OH radicals of those pesticides for which experimental transformation rates (of homologues) are available.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Emission of pesticides into the air.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  During and after the application of a pesticide in agriculture, a substantial fraction of the dosage may enter the atmosphere and be transported over varying distances downwind of the target. The rate and extent of the emission during application, predominantly as spray particle drift, depends primarily on the application method (equipment and technique), the formulation and environmental conditions, whereas the emission after application depends primarily on the properties of the pesticide, soils, crops and environmental conditions. The fraction of the dosage that misses the target area may be high in some cases and more experimental data on this loss term are needed for various application types and weather conditions. Such data are necessary to test spray drift models, and for further model development and verification as well. Following application, the emission of soil fumigants and  soil incorporated pesticides into the air can be measured and computed with reasonable accuracy, but further model development is needed to improve the reliability of the model predictions. For soil surface applied pesticides reliable measurement methods are available, but there is not yet a reliable model. Further model development is required which must be verified by field experiments. Few data are available on pesticide volatilization from plants and more field experiments are also needed to study the fate processes on the plants. Once this information is available, a model needs to be developed to predict the volatilization of pesticides from plants, which, again, should be verified with field measurements. For regional emission estimates, a link between data on the temporal and spatial pesticide use and a geographical information system for crops and soils with their characteristi cs is needed.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Regulatory risk assessment of pesticide residues in air.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Background information describing current approaches taken by different countries to risk assessment in regard of pesticide residues in air is presented with a view to stimulating discussion of the subject in order to identify means for improving both the underlying science and administrative procedures concerned. Fundamental regulatory objectives are explored, alternative guidelines for conduct of exposure evaluation, risk assessment and regulatory decision making are examined and the basic components of the technical framework in which this complex work is carried out are discussed. The criteria which are capable of being used for regulatory decision support are considered with a view to questioning their feasibility for practical use and relevance for operation to provide a robust basis for regulatory risk assessment for plant protection products. Brief recommendations are given for a spects of discussion where attention should be focused.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Modelling of atmospheric transport and deposition of pesticides.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Modelling of atmospheric transport and deposition of pesticides is presented and discussed. Modelling on regional scale builds on the existing knowledge gained in other air pollution fields. An overview of current modelling studies on transport and deposition on a regional scale (typically 30-3000 km) is given. From these studies it is concluded that the models are capable in simulating the spatial distribution of the concentrations and depositions. However, large uncertainties are present in this type of modelling and are for the greater part induced by the uncertainty in the emissions and subsequently in the exchange process parameterisations and the physicochemical properties needed in the parameterisations. Many more measurement data are needed to validate the models.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Micrometeorologic methods for measuring the post-application volatilization of pesticides.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  A wide variety of micrometeorological measurement methods can be used to estimate the postapplication volatilization of pesticides from treated fields. All these estimation methods require that the entire study area have the same surficial characteristics, including the area surrounding the actual study site, and that the pesticide under investigation be applied as quickly and as uniformly as possible before any measurements are made. Methods such as aerodynamic profile, energy balance, eddy correlation, and relaxed eddy accumulation require a large (typically 1 or more hectare) study area so that the flux measurements can be made in a well developed atmospheric boundary-layer and that steady-state conditions exist. The area surrounding the study plot should have similar surficial characteristics as the study plot with sufficient upwind extent so the wind speed and temperature gradients  are fully developed. Mass balance methods such as integrated horizontal flux and trajectory simulations do not require a large source area, but the area surrounding the study plot should have similar surficial characteristics. None of the micrometeorological techniques for estimating the postapplication volatilization fluxes of pesticides disturb the environment or the soil processes that influence the gas exchange from the surface to the atmosphere. They allow for continuous measurements and provide a temporally averaged flux value over a large area. If the behavior of volatilizing pesticides and the importance of the volatilization process in redistributing pesticides in the environment are to be fully understood, it is critical that we understand not only the processes that govern pesticide entry into the lower atmosphere, but also how much of the millions of kilograms of pesticides t hat are applied annually are introduced into, and redistributed by, the atmosphere. We also must be aware of the assumptions and limitations of the estimation techniques used, and adapt the field of pesticide volatilization flux measurements to advances in atmospheric science.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Ecotoxicological risk assessment of pesticides subject to long-range transport.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Concern has arisen about the possible ecological effects of persistent pesticides that become airborne during or after application and are transported to regions far away from where they were applied. In this paper an ecotoxicological approach is outlined that may support assessments of products suspected of long-range transport capacity. It is proposed that the risk is estimated from a classical PNEC comparison for the surface layer of a remote area, where PEC is estimated from dose rate, emission factors, atmospheric residence time and persistence, while PNEC is estimated from ecotoxicological information collected as part of the registration procedure. According to this "null model", risk assessment of pesticides subject to long-range transport is not different from the usual risk assessment, provided that due attention is paid to losses occurring during transport and accumulation  in remote areas with low temperature. A simplified equation is derived for estimating PEC from therecommended dose rate, which shows that the concentration in the remote area is higher than in the target area only if its residence time is at least two ordes of magnitude longer than the corresponding value in the target area. A review of ecotoxicity data for effects of volatile pesticides on arthropods indicates that effect levels in the air compartment are far above the concentrations of concern in long-range transport. Arguments supporting the view that remote areas, specifically the polar regions, are characterized by ecosystems that are more vulnerable than the ones on which the usual risk assessment is based, are reviewed. Although residues of organochlorines are of concern, there does not seem to be concrete epidemiological or experimental evidence about effects of modern pesticide s on wildlife in remote areas. It is concluded that there is no reason to reject the "null model" at the moment, however, in view of the large uncertainty involved, it is proposed that the maximum acceptable ratio between PNEC and PEC be increased by an extra safety factor.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Atmospheric dispersion of current-use pesticides: A review of the evidence from monitoring studies.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Recently, evidence has accumulated that the extensive use of modern pesticides results in their presence in the atmosphere at many places throughout the world. In Europe over 80 current-use pesticides have been detected in rain and 30 in air. Similar observations have been made in North America. The compounds most often looked for and detected are the organochlorine insecticide lindane and triazine herbicides, especially atrazine. However, acetanilide and phenoxyacid herbicides, as well as organophosphorus insecticides have also frequently been found in rain and air. Concentrations in air normally range from a few pg/m3 to many ng/m3. Concentrations in rain generally range from a few ng to several mug/L. In fog even higher concentrations are observed. Deposition varies between a few mg/ha/y and more than 1 g/ha/y per compound. However, these estimates are usually based on the collection  and analysis of (bulk) precipitation and do not include dry particle deposition and gas exchange. Nevertheless, model calculations, analysis of plant tissue, and first attempts to measure dry deposition in a more representative way, all indicate that total atmospheric deposition probably does not normally exceed a few g/ha/y. So far, little attention has been paid to the presence of transformation products of modern pesticides in the atmosphere, with the exception of those of triazine herbicides, which have been looked for and found frequently. Generally, current-use pesticides are only detected at elevated concentrations in air and rain during the application season. The less volatile and more persistent ones, such as lindane, but to some extent also triazines, are present in the atmosphere in low concentrations throughout the year. In agricultural areas, the presence of modern pestici des in the atmosphere can be explained by the crops grown and pesticides used on them. They are also found in the air and rain in areas where they are not used, sometimes even in remote places, just like their organochlorine predecessors. Concentrations and levels are generally much lower there. These data suggest that current-use pesticides can be transported through the atmosphere over distances of tens to hundreds, and sometimes even more than a thousand kilometres. The relative importance of these atmospheric inputs varies greatly. For mountainous areas and remote lakes and seas, the atmosphere may constitute the sole route of contamination by pesticides. In coastal waters, on the other hand, riverine inputs may prevail. To date, little is known about the ecological significance of these aerial inputs.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Environmental risk assessment for pesticides in the atmosphere; the results of an international workshop.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The Health Council of the Netherlands organised an international workshop on the fate of pesticides in the atmosphere and possible approaches for their regulatory environmental risk assessment. Approximately forty experts discussed what is currently known about the atmospheric fate of pesticides and major gaps in our understanding were identified. They favoured a tiered approach for assessing the environmental risks of atmospheric dispersion of these chemicals. In the first tier a pesticide's potential for emission during application, as well as its volatilisation potential should be assessed. Estimates of the former should be based on the application method and the formulation, estimates of the latter on a compound's solubility in water, saturated vapour pressure and octanol/water partition coefficient. Where a pesticide's potential for becoming airborne exceeds critical values, it shou ld be subjected to a more rigorous second tier evaluation which considers its toxicity to organismsin non-target areas. This evaluation can be achieved by calculating and comparing a predicted environmental concentration (PEC) and a predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC). By applying an extra uncertainty factor the PNEC can be provisionally derived from standard toxicity data that is already required for the registration of pesticides. Depending on the distance between the source and the reception area, the PEC can be estimated for remote areas using simple dispersion, trajectory type models and for nearby areas using common dispersion models and standard scenarios of pesticide use. A pesticide's atmospheric transport potential is based on factors such as its reaction rate with OH radicals. It should be used to discriminate between those compounds for which only the risks to nearby eco systems have to be assessed, and those for which the risks to remote ecosystems also have to be determined. The participants were of the opinion that this approach is, in principle, scientifically feasible, although the remaining uncertainties are substantial. Further field and laboratory research is necessary to gain more reliable estimates of the physico-chemical properties of pesticides, to validate and improve environmental fate models and to validate the applicability of standard toxicity data. This will increase both the accuracy of and our confidence in the outcome of the risk assessment.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>The study on the organic compounds in drinking water in the Kashin-Beck disease-endemic areas.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The theory which focuses on the organic compounds in drinking water is assumed to be one of the three theories on the etiology of KBD. The research began with gathering 200 literes of drinking water in each of diseased places including Mangkeng village, Majiatu village of Yulin region in the north of Shaaxin province and Xianfeng village, Hanjia village of Bin county in the west of Shaaxin province and Changhaize village of Yulin region as the non-diseased place. Collected by XAD-7, the organic compounds in them were extracted by methanol and acetone, and identified by the instrument GC/DS. There were 6 groups of organic compounds (12 kinds) among the samples of drinking water in the diseased places, including alkylhydroxyl dihydronaphthalene and phthalate which were harmful and whose relative contents were more than 74% in total organic compounds. There were 5 groups of organic compo unds (7 kinds) in the sample of drinking water in the non-diseased control place, in which the relative contents of the harmful were 33%. The particularly stronger absorbing peaks in infrared spectrograph of the samples of the diseased places were in 1 100 cm-1, 1 630 cm-1 and 850 cm-1, which mainly included aromatic hydrocarbon, alcohol and amide. The same absorbing peaks in the sample of the non-diseased place were very lower, revealing distinct difference between the diseased places and the non-diseased place. So we suppose benzene rings (including aromatic hydrocarbon and alkylphenol, etc) should be associated with KBD in the etiology./POISONING</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Hydrocarbons detected in irradiated shell eggs during storage.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Hydrocarbons produced by gamma-radiation of shell eggs were analyzed to determine how irradiation affects their production. Shell eggs were nonirradiated or irradiated at 0.5, 1, and 3 kGy and the stored at 5&amp;#176;C for 8 wk or at 30&amp;#176;C for 10 d. Hydrocarbons were determined by a sequential procedure of lipid extraction by hexane, Florisil column chromatography, and gas chromatography. Hydrocarbons C15:0, C14:1, C17:0, C16:1, C17:1, C16:2, C17:2, and C16:3 were detected in shell eggs irradiated at 0.5 kGy or higher, but not in nonirradiated ones except C15:0 and C17:0. Storage of nonirradiated or irradiated eggs had little effect on detection levels of hydrocarbons. The detection levels in all the samples irradiated at 1 and 3 kGy were in the order of C16:2 + C17:1, C15:0 + C14:1, C17:2 + C16:3, and C17:0 + C16:1 from the highest to the lowest.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Contamination of highly weathered urban soils in Uberlandia, Brazil.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  We determined heavy metal, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in 18 topsoils of Uberlandia (420,000 inhabitants, Brazil) and in 3 rural topsoils. Concentrations of Al (11-124 g kg-1) and Fe (13-109 g kg-1) are large because of desilification. Concentrations of Cd (0.1-0.5 mg kg-1), Cr (13-72), Cu (6-154), Mn (28-974), Ni (4-29), Pb (3-26), Zn (4-107), the sum of 20 PAHs (= 20PAHs:7-390 mug kg-1), and the sum of 14 PCBs (= 14PCBs:0.05-1.25) are comparable to or below background concentrations in temperate soils except for Cu at two sites. More than 67% of the metals are strongly bound in Fe oxides and silicates; metals are more bioavailable in the urban than in the rural soils. The most abundant PAHs in the urban soils, on average, are naphthalene (19.0 | 13.4% of  20PAHs) and the benzo(b+j+k)fluoranthenes (11.4 | 6.7%); the most abunda nt PCBs are nos. 138 (23.3 | 11.0% of  14PCBs) and 153 (14.3 | 6.4%). The rural soils contain larger percentages of low molecular PAHs and up to tetra-chlorinated PCBs than the urban soils. The different pollutant concentrations and patterns in the studied tropical compared with many temperate soils indicate different sources and fate.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>The impact of reduced atmospheric depositions on soil microbial parameters in a strongly acidified Norway spruce forest at Solling, Germany.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  To simulate a future ion input reduction scenario in forests, a large scale field experiment was set up in a (1999) 66-year-old Norway spruce plantation at Solling, central Germany. Throughfall input of H+, SO42-, and N-compounds is artificially reduced by means of a permanent roof construction below the canopy and a deionizing equipment since 1991. Here we present long term soil solution records for SO42-, NO3-, Al3+ and the pH of the 10 cm mineral soil sampling depth. A significant decrease in ion concentrations since the start of the treatment is observed, but no change of the soil solution pH. Even in the fourth year pH values remained well within the aluminium buffer range (pH &lt; 4.2). Three years after the start of the experiment (July 1994) it was examined whether microbial biomass (Cmic), specific activity (heat production per unit biomass), and the percentage of Cmic in organic C  material indicated any changes. Furthermore chemical standard parameters (CEC, base saturation, pH) were analyzed for all soil samples. Results indicate that despite of drastic decreases of soil solution ion concentrations in the upper soil horizons microbial parameters were not affected and that the soil solid phase is not deacidified by the treatment until now.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Stable isotope (delta13C and delta15N) signatures of sedimented organic matter as indicators of historic lake trophic state.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  We explored the use of carbon and nitrogen isotopes (delta13C and delta15N) in sedimented organic matter (OM) as proxy indicators of trophic state change in Florida lakes. Stable isotope data from four 210Pb-dated sediment cores were compared stratigraphically with established proxies for historical trophic state (diatom-inferred limnetic total phosphorus, sediment C ratio) and indicators of cultural disturbance (sediment total P and 226Ra activity). Diatom-based limnetic total P inferences indicate a transition from oligo-mesotrophy to meso-eutrophy in Clear Lake, and from eutrophy to hypereutrophy in Lakes Parker, Hollingsworth and Griffin. In cores from all four lakes, the carbon isotopic signature of accumulated OM generally tracks trophic state inferences and cultural impact assessments based on other variables. Oldest sediments in the records yield lower diatom-inferred total limnetic P  concentrations and display relatively low delta13C values. In the Clear, Hollingsworth and Parker records, diatom-inferred nutrient concentrations increase after ca. AD 1900, and are associated stratigraphically with higher delta13C values in sediment OM. In the Lake Griffin core, both proxies display slight increases before  1900, but highest values occur over the last  100 years. As Lakes Clear, Hollingsworth and Parker became increasingly nutrient-enriched over the past century, the delta15N of sedimented organic matter decreased. This reflects, in part, the increasing relative contribution of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria to sedimented organic matter as primary productivity increased in these waterbodies. The Lake Griffin core displays a narrow range of both delta13C and delta15N values. Despite the complexity of carbon and nitrogen cycles in lakes, stratigraphic agreement between diatom-inferred change s in limnetic total P and the stable isotope signatures of sedimented OM suggests that delta13C and delta15N reflect shifts in historic lake trophic state.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Development of a pesticide exclusion technique for assessing the impact of biological control agents for Chrysanthemoides monilifera.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  Seven biological control agents have been released on the environmental weed Chrysanthemoides monilifera in Australia and two are widely established on infestations of C. monilifera subsp. rotundata in New South Wales. Five pesticides were screened for their impact on seed production of C. monilifera and two on the survival of the agent Comostolopsis germana, a shoot tip-feeding lepidopteran. The insecticides carbaryl, carbofuran, dimethoate, fluvalinate and the fungicide benomyl had no significant effect on seed production of C. monilifera when applied over a period of four months. Numbers of C. germana larvae were readily suppressed after three months by applications of fluvalinate or a mixture of carbaryl, carbofuran and dimethoate. Shoot growth was not affected by applications of carbaryl, dimethoate and benomyl. It is concluded that exclusion by pesticides of biological control agen ts is a valid method of measuring the impact of agents on C. monilifera.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Survey on the material test, leaching test and the contents of N-nitrosamines in baby nipples.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  In order to investigate the sanitation and safety of commercial available baby nipples, from July 1994 to June 1995, a total of 31 samples that included 20 silicon and 11 rubber nipples were collected and examined. All tests followed the official methods and hygienic standards of Taiwan. In the material test, lead and cadmium were not detected in any of the 31 samples. In the leaching test, the consumption of potassium permanganate in all the samples was found to be 0.3  9.5 ppm. The contents of zinc and evaporated residues were 0.03 0.4 ppm and 9  24 ppm, respectively. Other tested items, such as phenol and formaldehyde, were found to be below the hygienic limit. In analysis of N-nitrosamines, NDMA, NDEA, NDPA, NDBA, NPIP, NPYR and NMOR were analyzed using a gas chromatography-thermal energy analyzer (GC-TEA). Of the 31 samples analyzed, N-nitrosamines were detected in 7 samples and the  content ranged from 1.1 84.8 ppb. All of these 7 samples were made of silicone. Three samples (9.7%), including 2 domestic and 1 imported nipples, violated the tolerance level set by the Department of Health.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>The promise and peril of soil and water resources of Jordan.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  As a country of arid climate, Jordan suffers from a serious shortage of good quality water for domestic and agricultural consumption. Although availability of water is the limiting factor to productive agriculture, Jordanian soils are burdened by additional problems among which are salinity, sodicity, poor structural stability, surface crust, soil erosion, subsurface layer compaction, and accumulation of heavy metals and pesticide residues. The water shortage has left no option but to mix poor quality water produced from Khirbit Es-Samra Treatment Plant with fresh runoff water collected in King Talal Reservoir. The water mixture is characterized by elevated pH and HCO3 concentration which, in turn, causes precipitation of soluble Ca as CaCO3, especially, when employing that water in drip irrigation. Moreover, runoff water generated from Amman - Zerqa metropolitan area is contaminated wit h Pb as indicated by the relatively high Pb concentration in the KTR water. In this regard, Average Pb concentration may reach 29 and 31 mug in surface and bottom waters, respectively. Because of the water shortage, excessive pumpage of ground water from Dhuleil Aquifer over 30 years period has resulted in elevated water salinity with chloridic nature. The Cl salts represent about 80% of the total soluble salts. The crust formation on surface soil enhances soil erosion which increases suspended fine clay in runoff water. Such a turbid water is known to cause substantial and rapid drop in infiltration rate and soil hydraulic conductivity due to the formation of depositional crust. This paper reviews the extent of these problems and proposes strategies for sustainable management of Jordan's soil and water resources.</AbstractText>

<ArticleTitle>Elevated urine uranium excretion by soldiers with retained uranium shrapnel.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>BIOSIS  COPYRIGHT: BIOL ABS.  The use of depleted uranium in munitions has given rise to a new exposure route for this chemically and radioactively hazardous metal. A cohort of U.S. soldiers wounded while on or in vehicles struck by depleted uranium penetrators during the Persian Gulf War was identified. Thirty-three members of this cohort were clinically evaluated, with particular attention to renal abnormalities, approximately 3 y after their injury. The presence of retained shrapnel was identified by x ray, and urine uranium concentrations were measured on two occasions. The absorption of uranium from embedded shrapnel was strongly suggested by measurements of urine uranium excretion at two time intervals: one in 1993/1994 and one in 1995. Mean urine uranium excretion was significantly higher in soldiers with retained shrapnel compared to those without shrapnel at both time points (4.47 vs. 0.03 mug g-1 creatinine  in 1993/1994 and 6.40 vs. 0.01 mug g-1 creatinine in 1995, respectively). Urine uranium concentrations measured in 1995 were consistent with those measured in 1994/1993, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9. Spot urine measurements of uranium excretion were also well correlated with 24-h urine collections (r = 0.95), indicating that spot urine samples can be reliably used to monitor depleted uranium excretion in the surveillance program for this cohort of soldiers. The presence of uranium in the urine can be used to determine the rate at which embedded depleted uranium fragments are releasing biologically active uranium ions. No evidence of a relationship between urine uranium excretion and renal function could be demonstrated. Evaluation of this cohort continues.</AbstractText>
